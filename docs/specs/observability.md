## Name

Observability & Audit Trail

## Purpose

Ensure that all critical actions in CivicPress — from feedback to approvals to
workflow execution — are **visible, traceable, and auditable**. 
This supports civic trust, debugging, transparency, and operational health.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Log all significant events (CLI, API, UI)
- Track workflow execution and errors
- Enable audit logs of civic record changes
- Collect basic metrics for performance monitoring

Out of Scope:

- Full-stack tracing (handled by external APM tools)
- Usage analytics of end users (unless anonymized)

---

## Inputs & Outputs

| Triggered by | Logged to |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| CLI or API command | `.civic/logs/action.log.jsonl` |
| Workflow run | `.civic/hooks.log.jsonl` |
| Error/exception | `.civic/logs/error.log.jsonl` |
| Audit action (approve) | `.civic/audit.log.jsonl` |

## Example Observability Configuration

```yaml
# .civic/observability.yml
logging:
 level: 'info' # debug, info, warn, error
 format: 'jsonl'
 rotation:
 max_size: '10MB'
 max_files: 5
 compress: true

 files:
 action: '.civic/logs/action.log.jsonl'
 error: '.civic/logs/error.log.jsonl'
 audit: '.civic/logs/audit.log.jsonl'
 hooks: '.civic/hooks.log.jsonl'

monitoring:
 metrics:
 enabled: true
 port: 9090
 path: '/metrics'

 health_checks:
 enabled: true
 interval: '30s'
 endpoints:
 - '/health'
 - '/ready'
 - '/live'

audit:
 enabled: true
 redact_sensitive: true
 public_logs: ['audit', 'hooks']
 private_logs: ['action', 'error']

 events:
 - 'user.login'
 - 'record.create'
 - 'record.update'
 - 'record.delete'
 - 'vote.cast'
 - 'signature.add'
 - 'workflow.execute'
 - 'backup.create'

alerts:
 webhooks:
 - url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/...'
 events: ['error', 'backup.failed']

 email:
 enabled: false
 smtp_host: 'smtp.town.ca'
 recipients: ['admin@town.ca']
```

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Logs should redact sensitive info before commit
- Some logs (audit, workflow) may be public, others private
- CLI or server may use `logLevel` config to filter verbosity
- Tamper detection (sign logs) may be added in the future

---

## Testing & Validation

- Trigger known CLI/API actions and confirm logs
- Validate log rotation or cleanup behavior
- Confirm that logs are JSONL and parseable
- Simulate workflow errors and ensure visibility

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- CivicPress dashboard with status/metrics (live observability)
- Pluggable external sinks (e.g., Loki, Logstash, Sentry)
- Real-time webhook monitor
- Graph of event correlation (feedback → workflow → result)
