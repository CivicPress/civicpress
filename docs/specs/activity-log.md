## Name

Activity Log & Civic Audit Trail

## Purpose

Track all significant user and system actions — providing a **transparent audit
trail** of edits, approvals, feedback, logins, and system events. 
Supports traceability, trust, and debugging across all CivicPress modules.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Log meaningful actions (create, edit, delete, approve, flag)
- Store user ID, timestamp, action type, record path, and payload summary
- Support CLI and API queries for activity history
- Enable filters by user, type, or module
- Append-only JSONL log with optional signing

Out of Scope:

- Fine-grained real-time telemetry (see `observability.md`)
- Tamper-proofing (see `data-integrity.md`)

---

## Inputs & Outputs

| Action | Logged |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Approve a bylaw | `record-approved` with metadata |
| Submit feedback | `feedback-submitted` log entry |
| Edit a module config | `module-edited` event |
| CLI: `civic log` | Query activity trail |
| API: `/api/logs?user=...` | Filter logs by user or action |

## Example Log Entry

```json
{
 "timestamp": "2025-07-04T14:44:00Z",
 "user": "u-irene-curie",
 "action": "record-approved",
 "record": "records/bylaws/curfew.md",
 "module": "legal-register"
}
```

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Logs must be append-only
- Sensitive actions (deletion, approval) should include actor info
- Optionally sign each log entry with instance key
- May redact or anonymize some actions if needed

---

## Testing & Validation

- Simulate common actions (edit, submit, approve)
- Confirm logs written correctly and sequentially
- Validate log queries by type/user/date
- Ensure error handling for malformed entries

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- Export to CSV or PDF audit report
- GraphQL interface for dashboards
- Log tamper detection
- Signed digest of logs per day/week (e.g. Merkle root)
