## 📛 Name

Civic Notifications System

## 🎯 Purpose

Enable CivicPress to notify relevant users or external systems when civic events
occur — such as approvals, feedback received, or new proposals. This supports
transparency, accountability, and timely decision-making.

Notifications may be local (in-app), remote (webhook), or outbound (email/SMS).

---

## 🧩 Scope & Responsibilities

✅ Responsibilities:

- Trigger notifications on system events (`hook:`-based)
- Support multiple channels (email, webhook, CLI, UI)
- Route messages based on user roles or subscriptions
- Log all notifications for auditing

❌ Out of Scope:

- Real-time presence or WebSocket chat
- Delivery retries or guaranteed delivery (handled by future queue system)

## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

### Notification Channel Security

- All webhook endpoints must be cryptographically signed with HMAC-SHA256
- Email addresses validated and verified before notification delivery
- Rate limiting per user and per notification type to prevent spam
- TLS encryption required for all outbound notification channels
- Webhook retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns

### Content Protection & Privacy

- Sensitive data automatically redacted from notification content
- Personal information (PII) filtered out of public notification logs
- Notification content encrypted in transit and at rest
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies for notification history
- User consent management for notification subscriptions

### Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-factor authentication required for notification system access
- Role-based access control for notification subscription management
- Audit trail of all notification system access and configuration changes
- Session management with automatic timeout for notification admin interfaces

### Delivery Verification & Compliance

- Delivery receipts and read confirmations for critical notifications
- Non-repudiation through cryptographic signatures on notification payloads
- Compliance logging for legal and regulatory requirements
- Tamper-evident audit trails for all notification activities

### Abuse Prevention & Monitoring

- Machine learning detection of notification spam and abuse patterns
- Real-time monitoring of notification volume and delivery success rates
- Automated alerts for unusual notification patterns or failures
- Blacklist/whitelist management for notification recipients

### Data Sovereignty & Localization

- Notification data stored in compliance with local data protection laws
- Support for region-specific notification templates and requirements
- Localization of notification content and delivery preferences
- Cross-border data transfer compliance for international notifications

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Trigger test events and confirm outbound logs
- Validate webhook delivery and fallback
- Ensure logs include timestamp, role, and event metadata
- Confirm CLI and API trigger hooks consistently

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Add queue system for retries and scheduling
- Support digest summary notifications (daily, weekly)
- Civic dashboard for notifications & history
- Citizen-facing subscription model (per record/tag)
- i18n templating for multilingual messages
