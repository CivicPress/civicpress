## 📛 Name

Civic Record Lifecycle

## 🎯 Purpose

Define how civic records (e.g. bylaws, minutes, proposals) transition through
various lifecycle stages — from draft to adoption, amendment, retirement, and
archival.

This ensures long-term clarity and consistency across all records.

---

## 🧩 Scope & Responsibilities

✅ Responsibilities:

- Define valid lifecycle states (`draft`, `proposed`, `adopted`, `amended`,
  `archived`, `repealed`)
- Allow records to update `status:` and track transitions
- Ensure consistent UI, API, and CLI behavior per stage
- Link related versions (e.g. `amends: bylaw-2018-12`)
- Handle content withdrawal or deprecation

❌ Out of Scope:

- File deletion (files are always retained via Git)
- Legal enforcement or interpretation

## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

- Only authorized users can change lifecycle status
- Transitions should trigger hooks or workflow validation
- Changes must be logged in Git or audit system

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Validate status tags for invalid states
- Check state transitions via CLI/API
- Ensure proper references to older records
- Test archival automation via `scheduler.md`

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Lifecycle visualization UI (graph of changes)
- Cross-record diff for amendments
- Draft collaboration mode
- Policy rules per module type (e.g. permits vs minutes)
