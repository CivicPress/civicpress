## Name

Civic Record Signatures

## Purpose

Allow civic records — like bylaws, minutes, or decisions — to be **digitally
signed** by authorized individuals or systems. 
This ensures traceability, trust, and legal authenticity in both local and
remote governance.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Allow signing of records via CLI or API
- Store signature metadata in frontmatter or alongside record
- Support GPG or signature hash systems (MVP = plaintext log)
- Verify signatures during audits or approvals
- Allow multiple signers (e.g. Mayor, Clerk)

Out of Scope:

- Blockchain notarization (can be added later)
- Secure certificate authority integration (not MVP)

---

## Inputs & Outputs

| Action | Result |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `civic sign record.md` | Adds/updates `signed_by:` field |
| `civic verify record.md` | Confirms known signature or mismatch |
| API approval via webhook | May include digital token |

---

## Example Frontmatter

```yaml
title: 'Bylaw 2025-14: Curfew'
status: adopted
signed_by:
 - name: 'Ada Lovelace'
 role: 'Mayor'
 date: '2025-07-03'
 key: 'GPG:4A3B...EEA1'
```

---

## File/Folder Location

```
records/bylaws/2025-14-curfew.md
.civic/signatures/ # Optional GPG storage or metadata
```

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Signing actions must be auditable and role-restricted
- Signature hash or key ID must match signer identity
- `verify` CLI must warn on mismatch or altered content
- Signatures must apply to frozen/committed content only

---

## Testing & Validation

- Sign valid and invalid records
- Verify correct parsing and signature metadata
- Attempt forgery or content tampering — ensure detection
- Validate signature chain for multi-signer approval

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- GPG or Minisign key management
- Signature trust chains or delegation
- Signature verification UI
- Optional blockchain anchoring
- QR code print exports for on-paper validation
