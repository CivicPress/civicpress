## 📛 Name

Civic Record Status Tags

## 🎯 Purpose

Establish a shared vocabulary for tracking the **lifecycle status** of civic
records — whether proposed, under review, approved, archived, or retracted.  
This ensures clarity, consistency, and automation across modules and interfaces.

---

## 🧩 Scope & Responsibilities

✅ Responsibilities:

- Define allowed `status:` values for civic records
- Enable UI filters, workflows, and color badges based on status
- Track lifecycle transitions (e.g. `proposed → adopted`)
- Provide default badge labels for public display

❌ Out of Scope:

- Authorizing status changes (handled by workflows/permissions)
- Legal implications of a tag (defined by each town)

---

## 🔗 Inputs & Outputs

| `status:` Value | Meaning                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| `proposed`      | Submitted for review                    |
| `rejected`      | Voted down or returned                  |
| `adopted`       | Officially approved and enacted         |
| `archived`      | No longer active, preserved for history |
| `superseded`    | Replaced by a newer record              |

## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

### Status Transition Security

- Cryptographic signatures required for all status change operations
- Multi-factor authentication for critical status transitions
- Role-based access control with granular permissions per status type
- Audit trail with tamper-evident logging for all status changes
- Approval workflow for sensitive status transitions (e.g., adopted → retracted)

### Data Integrity & Validation

- Input validation and sanitization for all status tag content
- Prevention of malicious code injection through status descriptions
- Automated detection of inappropriate or offensive status labels
- Version control and rollback capability for status configuration changes
- Regular security audits of status management systems

### Access Control & Permissions

- Granular permissions for status creation, modification, and deletion
- Multi-factor authentication for status administrator access
- Approval workflow for new status types and tag categories
- Emergency lockdown capability for status system during security incidents
- Audit logging of all status-related activities and configuration changes

### Compliance & Governance

- Compliance with municipal record-keeping requirements and regulations
- Legal review process for status definitions and transition rules
- Support for public records laws and transparency requirements
- Compliance with data retention policies for status history
- Regular legal audits of status management practices

### Abuse Prevention & Monitoring

- Rate limiting and abuse detection for status tag creation and modification
- Machine learning detection of coordinated status manipulation attempts
- Real-time monitoring of status change patterns and volume
- Automated alerts for unusual status activity or potential abuse
- Blacklist/whitelist management for status tag content

### Transparency & Accountability

- Public transparency logs for non-sensitive status changes
- Cryptographic verification of status change authenticity
- Immutable audit trails for all status-related activities
- Support for public records requests and legal discovery
- Regular transparency reports and compliance audits

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Validate all status values against spec
- Confirm UI displays correct badges
- Test filtering by status in CLI and UI
- Ensure workflows trigger on status transitions

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Custom town-defined statuses in `.civic/status.yml`
- Status-specific print or display templates
- Timeline of status history per record
