## Name

`review-policy` — Record Review & Approval Policy

## Purpose

Define how civic records move through **review and approval workflows** before
being published, adopted, or archived. 
This includes contributor roles, PR-style approvals, and customizable review
gates for transparency and accountability.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Specify how many approvals are required for record adoption
- Define who can approve records (roles, committees)
- Support PR-style workflows via Git or UI
- Allow review policies to vary by record type (e.g. bylaw vs. minutes)
- Track review status in metadata and audit logs

Out of Scope:

- Voting results (covered by `votes.md`)
- Moderation or spam protection

---

## Inputs & Outputs

| Action | Result |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| User proposes new record | Status = `proposed` |
| Required approvals are met | Status = `adopted`, `approved`, etc. |
| `review-policy.yml` says 2 signers | Blocks until 2 valid approvals given |
| Record history shows reviewers | Audit and trust preserved |

## File/Folder Location

```

## Example `review-policy.yml`

```yaml
defaults:
 required_approvals: 2
 eligible_roles: [clerk, mayor, councilor]

rules:
 bylaws/:
 required_approvals: 3
 eligible_roles: [clerk, councilor]

 minutes/:
 required_approvals: 1
 eligible_roles: [clerk]
```

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Approvers must be authenticated and authorized
- Review actions must be auditable
- Avoid single-user sign-off where possible
- Consider quorum and conflict-of-interest flags in future

---

## Testing & Validation

- Simulate approval flow for new record
- Attempt early merge without quorum — block it
- Ensure review logs are correctly formatted and traceable
- Confirm policy overrides work for specific folders

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- UI approval queue (inbox of pending items)
- Role-weighted or committee-based approvals
- Review expiry deadlines or reminders
- Delegation and proxy review
