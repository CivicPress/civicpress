## 📛 Name

Civic Record Voting System

## 🎯 Purpose

Allow councils, boards, and authorized users to **vote on civic records** such
as bylaws, proposals, or appointments — capturing democratic decision-making in
a structured, auditable way.

Votes may determine the status of a record (e.g. `proposed → adopted`), or serve
as a historical record of deliberation.

---

## 🧩 Scope & Responsibilities

✅ Responsibilities:

- Enable structured voting on records
- Track individual votes with metadata (who, how, when)
- Determine outcomes based on defined vote rules
- Update record `status:` if vote passes
- Display vote results in UI and API

❌ Out of Scope:

- Secret or anonymous voting
- Token-based or financial voting
- Complex vote weighting (initially)

## 🔗 Inputs & Outputs

| Action                        | Result                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `civic vote --yes bylaw.md`   | Records user's vote as "yes"     |
| GitHub PR comment: `vote: no` | Interpreted as structured vote   |
| Vote log file update          | Triggers possible status change  |
| `civic tally`                 | Displays or updates vote outcome |

---

## 📝 Vote Log Format

Stored in: `.civic/votes/bylaw-2025-18.json`

```json
{
  "record": "records/bylaws/2025-18-fireworks-ban.md",
  "outcome": "adopted",
  "threshold": "majority",
  "votes": [
    { "name": "Ada Lovelace", "vote": "yes", "date": "2025-07-03" },
    { "name": "Irène Joliot-Curie", "vote": "yes" },
    { "name": "Alan Turing", "vote": "no" }
  ]
}
```

## 📂 File/Folder Location

```
.civic/votes/
records/bylaws/*.md
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

- Only authorized roles may cast votes
- Vote logs are immutable once finalized
- Status updates require full vote tally
- Must clearly separate deliberation from adoption

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Simulate vote casting and outcome tally
- Check that invalid voters are rejected
- Ensure record status is not changed prematurely
- Display votes in UI with correct breakdown

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Abstain and conflict-of-interest options
- Custom vote thresholds (⅔, unanimous, quorum logic)
- Time-based voting windows
- Vote delegation and proxy features
- Verifiable civic vote receipts
