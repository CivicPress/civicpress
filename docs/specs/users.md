## üîê Security & Trust Considerations

- Email must be verified or restricted by domain (e.g. `@town.ca`)
- Actions (votes, signatures) must be traceable to a user
- Role escalation requires review

**Data Retention & Privacy:**

- Store only necessary user data; avoid collecting sensitive PII unless required
- Define retention period for inactive/deleted users and securely delete after
  expiry
- Anonymize or redact user data in public logs and exports
- Allow users to request data export or deletion (subject to legal requirements)

**Access Control:**

- Only authorized roles (e.g. clerk, admin) may create, edit, or delete users
- Enforce least-privilege principle for user permissions
- Log all user management actions for audit

**Authentication & Security:**

- Use secure authentication providers (e.g. GitHub OAuth, SSO)
- Store credentials and tokens securely; never store plaintext passwords
- Support multi-factor authentication (future)
- Invalidate sessions on password or role changes

**Compliance:**

- Ensure user data handling complies with local privacy and data protection laws
  (e.g. GDPR, municipal regulations)
- Document user data flows and access policies for auditability

**Best Practices:**

- Regularly review user roles and permissions
- Monitor for suspicious login or privilege escalation attempts
- Provide clear user-facing privacy and security policies

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- Create, delete, list, authenticate users
- Login flow (GitHub and fallback credentials)
- Role checks during CLI/API actions
- Session expiration and token validity

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Municipal SSO or eID login
- User settings and notifications
- Delegation and impersonation for accessibility
- Session replay for audit
