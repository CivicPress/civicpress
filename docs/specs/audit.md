## Name

Civic Audit Mechanism

## Purpose

Enable verifiable inspection of CivicPress records, actions, and logs — to
support legal compliance, third-party oversight, transparency, and historical
reconstruction.

This builds upon the `activity-log.md` and `data-integrity.md` specs.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Define audit modes (manual, scheduled, external)
- Provide tooling for reviewing logs, changes, signatures
- Detect missing files, inconsistent states, unauthorized edits
- Enable export of audit reports (PDF, JSON, Markdown)
- Distinguish between civic policy audit vs system health

Out of Scope:

- Legal interpretation of audit results
- Continuous monitoring (see `observability.md`)

---

## Audit Targets

| Target | Audit Includes |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Records | Status, version, lifecycle, manifest, signatures |
| Activity log | Gaps, anomalies, unknown actors |
| Workflows | Signed? Approved? Malicious triggers? |
| Permissions/Roles | Unauthorized privilege changes |
| File system state | Orphaned files, deleted/renamed without record |

## Example Anomaly Entry

```json
{
 "type": "signature-missing",
 "record": "records/bylaws/curfew.md",
 "detected_at": "2025-07-04T17:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Audit outputs must be immutable (Git-committed or signed)
- Some reports may contain sensitive metadata (e.g., internal roles)
- Only authorized users can generate or review audits

---

## Testing & Validation

- Simulate missing or invalid manifests
- Introduce permission mismatch or fake users
- Run audit CLI with known broken data
- Validate PDF/Markdown summary output

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- Web UI audit viewer
- Schedule audits (see `scheduler.md`)
- Notarize or timestamp audit result hashes
- Plugin interface for external auditors
