## 📛 Name

Civic Record Versioning

## 🎯 Purpose

Define how civic records in CivicPress are versioned over time using Git.  
Every edit, proposal, or adoption is traceable via commits, branches, and pull
requests — ensuring full public accountability and transparency.

---

## 🧩 Scope & Responsibilities

✅ Responsibilities:

- Track every change to civic records via Git
- Provide readable diffs and timeline views
- Represent lifecycle states (draft → proposed → adopted)
- Support rollback and recovery of past versions
- Encourage PR-based editing and review process

❌ Out of Scope:

- API route versioning (handled in `api.md`)
- Real-time collaborative editing (handled in future spec)

## 📉 Record Lifecycle Notes

CivicPress avoids hard-deletion of civic records.

End-of-life states are expressed as:

- `status: archived` — Still viewable, no longer in effect
- `status: superseded` — Replaced by a newer record
- `status: retracted` — Removed for legal or privacy reasons

Whenever possible, records should be retained and clearly linked to their
successors.

Archived or replaced records may be moved to a designated folder (e.g.,
`/records/archive/`) or tagged accordingly in frontmatter. Git history always
preserves full traceability.

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

- All commits must be signed or attributable
- History must not be force-pushed or rewritten without audit
- Changes must follow civic role approval policies
- Diff tooling should sanitize sensitive data when needed

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Validate Git repo integrity regularly
- Ensure proper PR and branch naming conventions
- Confirm restore functionality via commit checkout
- Ensure all civic changes are accompanied by metadata

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Add `/history/` viewer per record in public UI
- Auto-tag major civic milestones (`v1-adopted`, `v2-amended`)
- File-specific retention policies and annotations
- Automatic diff summaries in UI or CLI
