## Name

`workflows` — CivicPress Workflows Engine

## Purpose

To allow towns to define local civic logic (notifications, tagging, approvals)
using event-based JavaScript files stored in `.civic/workflows/`.

Workflows let CivicPress respond dynamically to civic events — without modifying
core logic.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Load `.js` files from the workflows folder
- Execute on matching hook events
- Provide safe civic context (record, user, timestamp)
- Enforce policy (signatures, dry-run, role checks)
- Log executions for audit trail

Out of scope:

- Unrestricted file system or network access
- Background job scheduling (separate system)
- Frontend workflow interface (UI is separate)

---

## Inputs & Outputs

Triggered by: Hook events from core or modules 
Input: Civic object payload and context 
Output: Actions taken, logs recorded

## Security & Trust Considerations

### Workflow Security

- All workflow files must be cryptographically signed or approved based on
 `workflow.policy.yml`
- Workflows must run in a secure sandbox environment (e.g., `vm2`)
- File system and network access must be explicitly permitted in policy
- Only authorized roles defined in policy can execute workflows
- All workflow executions must be logged for audit purposes

### Sandbox Security

- Workflow execution must be isolated from core system
- Memory and CPU limits must be enforced during execution
- Timeout limits must prevent infinite loops or hanging workflows
- Resource usage must be monitored and logged
- Sandbox permissions must be validated before execution

### Data Protection

- Workflow input data must be sanitized and validated
- Sensitive data must not be exposed to untrusted workflows
- Workflow output must be validated before applying changes
- Audit logs must capture all data access and modifications
- Data retention policies must be enforced for workflow logs

### Policy Enforcement

- Workflow policies must be validated before execution
- Role-based access control must be strictly enforced
- Policy changes must be reviewed and approved
- Policy violations must be logged and reported
- Default security policies must be applied to all workflows

### Compliance & Audit

- All workflow executions must be traceable and auditable
- Workflow logs must be immutable and tamper-evident
- Compliance with local regulations must be verified
- Regular security audits of workflow policies must be performed
- Workflow performance and security metrics must be monitored

---

## Testing & Validation

- Support `--dry-run` mode
- Simulate events via CLI (`civic run-workflow`)
- Ensure enforcement of policy restrictions
- Audit sandbox permissions with test suites

---

## Invocation Methods

- CLI: `civic run-workflow onRecordSubmit record.yaml`
- API: `POST /v1/hook/onRecordSubmit`
- Git hook: Triggered on `commit`, `push`, or `merge`

---

## Example Workflow: onRecordSubmit.js

```js
module.exports = async ({ record, context }) => {
 if (record.path.includes('bylaws/')) {
 await civic.appendTag(record, 'awaiting-legal');
 }
};
```

---

## Example Policy File: workflow.policy.yml

```yaml
trustedAuthors:
 - clerk-richmond
 - civic-devs
permissions:
 allowNetwork: false
 allowFilesystem: false
defaultMode: dry-run
```

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- Visual editor in admin UI
- Scheduled (cron-like) triggers
- Cross-module event chaining
- Workflow registry or marketplace
- WASM support for sandboxing
