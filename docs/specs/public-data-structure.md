## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

### Data Integrity & Authenticity

- All civic records cryptographically signed with GPG keys
- Digital signatures required for all record publications and amendments
- Immutable audit trail for all record changes and movements
- Version control with tamper-evident history for all civic records
- Automated detection of unauthorized modifications to civic records

### Access Control & Permissions

- Role-based access control for record creation and modification
- Granular permissions per record type and status
- Approval workflow for record publication and archival
- Emergency record lockdown capability during security incidents
- Audit logging of all record-related activities and access attempts

### Compliance & Legal Requirements

- Compliance with municipal record-keeping requirements
- Legal review process for record structure and organization
- Support for public records laws and transparency requirements
- Compliance with data retention policies for civic records
- Regular legal audits of record organization practices

### Data Protection & Privacy

- Encryption of sensitive record data in transit and at rest
- GDPR-compliant data handling for record metadata
- Anonymization of personal data in public records
- User consent management for record-related data processing
- Data sovereignty compliance for cross-border record storage

### Audit & Transparency

- Public transparency logs for all record operations
- Cryptographic verification of record authenticity
- Immutable audit trails for all data structure activities
- Support for public records requests and legal discovery
- Regular transparency reports and compliance audits

### Abuse Prevention & Monitoring

- Rate limiting and abuse detection for record operations
- Machine learning detection of coordinated record manipulation
- Real-time monitoring of record access patterns and volume
- Automated alerts for unusual record activity or potential abuse
- Blacklist/whitelist management for record content and metadata

## 📂 Hybrid Folder Structure

CivicPress separates civic record **evolution** from **organization**:

### 📘 `timeline/` — The Civic Ledger

```
records/
├── timeline/
│   ├── 2025-07-03/
│   │   ├── bylaw-curfew.md
│   │   └── motion-budget.md
│   ├── 2025-07-12/
│   │   └── bylaw-curfew.md
│   └── 2025-07-23/
│       └── bylaw-curfew.md
```

- Chronological folder = civic activity day
- Files reflect civic evolution (e.g., drafts, amendments, approvals)
- Every change is tracked in Git commits

### 📚 `bylaws/`, `minutes/` — Thematic Archive

```
records/
├── bylaws/
│   ├── section-01/
│   │   └── bylaw-curfew.md
├── minutes/
│   ├── regular/
│   │   └── meeting-2025-07-03.md
│   └── emergency/
```

- Once adopted, finalized records are moved (or referenced) here
- This is what citizens browse
- Mirrors government structure

---

## 🔁 Record Synchronization Policy

If a record exists in the structured folders (e.g.,
`bylaws/section-02/bylaw-curfew.md`) and future edits occur in the `timeline/`,
the structured file **must eventually reflect those changes**.

Valid approaches:

- ✅ Update the structured file in-place (with Git commit + changelog)
- ✅ Replace with a new version (archive the old version clearly)
- ✅ Use `source:` or `latest:` in frontmatter to link to the timeline

This ensures:

- The structured archive always reflects the most recent civic decisions
- The `timeline/` remains the canonical ledger of civic activity
- There is no ambiguity about which version is current

All modules that publish civic records **must respect this lifecycle**.

## 🧠 YAML Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
title: 'Bylaw on Park Regulation'
type: bylaw
status: draft
authors:
  - name: 'Ada Lovelace'
    role: 'clerk'
created: '2025-07-03'
updated: '2025-07-12'
tags: ['parks', 'safety']
reviewers: []
approved_by: []
module: 'legal-register'
source: 'timeline/2025-07-03/bylaw-park.md'
---
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- ✅ Create draft in `timeline/YYYY-MM-DD/` → visible in dev UI
- ✅ Commit edited record → tracked in Git with correct author
- ✅ Move record to `bylaws/` → `source:` link remains intact
- ✅ Render diff between timeline and structured file
- ✅ Run `civic lint:records` to validate naming, structure, frontmatter

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- `civic index` command to regenerate a public search index
- `civic trace` tool to follow a record's full evolution across timeline
- Ability to render a civic "ledger" from commits and frontmatter status
- Visual timeline explorer for historical civic decisions
