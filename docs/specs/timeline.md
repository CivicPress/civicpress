## Name

Civic Activity Timeline

## Purpose

Provide a chronological view of civic events, decisions, feedback, and changes —
to give users and contributors a clear picture of how governance unfolds over
time.

The timeline is both a **journal of civic activity** and a **development
sandbox** for drafts and proposals before they are moved into structured
modules.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Store daily entries of civic activity
- Accept any record type: proposals, drafts, discussions, etc.
- Enable visualization of activity by date
- Offer hooks for UI (calendar view, list, heatmap)
- Allow modules to reference timeline entries

Out of Scope:

- Serving as final record of law (those move to `bylaws/`, etc.)
- Full text search (handled by index)

---

## Inputs & Outputs

| Input | Result |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `timeline/2025-07-04/foo.md` | Appears in timeline view |
| Record with `date:` tag | Sorted and grouped chronologically |
| Hooked module entry | Displays link in timeline format |

## File/Folder Location

## Example Frontmatter

```yaml
title: 'Curfew Debate Summary'
authors:
 - name: 'Ada Lovelace'
 role: 'Clerk'
tags: [bylaw, discussion]
date: 2025-07-04
status: draft
```

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Timeline entries may include sensitive drafts
- Records must follow same permission rules as others
- Editing history should be tracked via Git or audit log

---

## Testing & Validation

- Render timeline chronologically with frontmatter parsing
- Validate date formatting and directory sorting
- Test references from other modules into timeline
- Simulate activity and visualize range of events

---

## ️ Future Enhancements

- UI calendar and list view modes
- Timeline filters by tag/author/module
- Record move suggestions (e.g. "This is a bylaw? Move to `/bylaws/`")
- CLI `civic timeline add` with prompts
