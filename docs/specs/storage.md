## Name

Civic Storage Layer

## Purpose

Define how CivicPress handles **non-Markdown content**, such as audio/video
files, PDFs, scanned permits, meeting recordings, and attachments. Ensure files
are stored predictably, retrievably, and securely — whether local-first or
backed by remote object storage.

**Version 2.0** introduces UUID-based file management, multi-provider backend
support, and seamless integration with the file attachment system for linking
files to civic records.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

Responsibilities:

- Store and serve non-Markdown files (media, attachments)
- Maintain consistent file paths across modules
- Support static/public + authenticated/private access
- Allow local disk or S3-style backends
- Expose storage location to API/UI
- **UUID-based file tracking** for unique identification
- **Multi-provider backend support** (local, S3, Azure)
- **File attachment integration** for linking files to records
- **Database metadata tracking** for file information

Out of Scope:

- CDN replication
- Media transcoding (handled externally)
- Sensitive personal data storage (unless encrypted)

## File/Folder Location

```
/storage/ # Public or private non-md assets
.civic/storage.yml # Backend config (e.g. type, credentials)
.system-data/ # Private system data including file metadata
├── files.db # SQLite database for file metadata tracking
└── storage-cache/ # Cached file information
```

## Example Storage Configuration

```yaml
# .civic/storage.yml
backend:
 type: 'local' # local, s3, minio, ipfs
 path: '/storage'

# For S3/MinIO backends
# backend:
# type: "s3"
# endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
# bucket: "civicpress-richmond"
# region: "us-east-1"
# credentials:
# access_key: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}"
# secret_key: "${AWS_SECRET_KEY}"

folders:
 public:
 path: '/storage/public'
 access: 'public'
 allowed_types: ['jpg', 'png', 'pdf', 'mp4', 'mp3']
 max_size: '10MB'

 private:
 path: '/storage/private'
 access: 'authenticated'
 allowed_types: ['pdf', 'doc', 'xlsx']
 max_size: '25MB'

 sessions:
 path: '/storage/sessions'
 access: 'public'
 allowed_types: ['mp4', 'webm', 'mp3']
 max_size: '100MB'

 permits:
 path: '/storage/permits'
 access: 'authenticated'
 allowed_types: ['pdf', 'jpg', 'png']
 max_size: '5MB'

metadata:
 auto_generate_thumbnails: true
 store_exif: false
 compress_images: true
 backup_included: true
```

---

## Backup Consideration

All media and attachments stored in `storage/` should be included in any
CivicPress backup or export process. This ensures full continuity and
traceability during restore or migration.

Future versions may define `.civic/backup.yml` for more advanced control.

---

## Security & Trust Considerations

- Access control must be enforced by API layer
- Folder-level visibility should match record permissions
- File metadata (`.meta.yml`) may store roles, license, tags
- Links to storage should not be hardcoded in civic records — use variables

**Encryption & Privacy:**

- Sensitive files (e.g. permits, legal docs) should be encrypted at rest and in
  transit (future: S3, MinIO, or local encryption)
- Store encryption keys securely and rotate regularly
- Do not store unencrypted personal data unless required by law

**Access Control:**

- Only authorized users/roles may upload, download, or delete files in private
  folders
- Public folders should be read-only for unauthenticated users
- Log all access to private or sensitive files for audit

**Compliance:**

- Ensure storage practices comply with local privacy and data protection laws
  (e.g. GDPR, municipal regulations)
- Redact or restrict access to files containing PII or confidential information
- Document storage structure and access policies for auditability

**Best Practices:**

- Regularly review and clean up orphaned or outdated files
- Include storage in backup and disaster recovery plans
- Monitor storage usage and alert on quota or access anomalies

---

## Testing & Validation

- Upload and retrieve sample media from UI/API
- Confirm file presence via `civic storage ls`
- Validate access control against roles
- Simulate offline/local-only fallback

---
