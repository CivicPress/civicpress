# CivicPress Governance Model

_A transparent, community-driven governance structure designed to protect the
public good._

**Version:** v0.1.3 (Alpha)  
**Audience:** Municipalities, contributors, advisors, and partner organizations

---

# 1. Purpose of This Document

CivicPress is an open-source civic infrastructure project.  
Its mission is to provide municipalities with durable, transparent, and
accessible digital tools built on open standards.

This document explains how the project is governed today and how governance will
expand as CivicPress grows.

# 2. Guiding Principles

CivicPress governance is built on the following principles:

### **1. Public Good First**

The platform must always serve citizens, democratic transparency, and municipal
autonomy.

### **2. Open and Inspectable**

All core decisions, specifications, and changes remain visible in public
repositories.

### **3. Neutrality**

CivicPress does not promote any political ideology and must remain
institutionally neutral.

### **4. Long-Term Stewardship**

Municipal data and civic processes require a platform designed to last for
decades.

### **5. Community Collaboration**

The project thrives on collaboration between technologists, clerks, archivists,
designers, accessibility experts, and civic innovators.

# 3. Current Governance (Founding Phase)

During the early alpha phase (v0.1.x), CivicPress is stewarded by a **Founding
Maintainer** who oversees:

- technical architecture
- roadmap direction
- code review
- documentation standards
- community coordination
- early municipal relationships

This ensures:

- fast iteration
- a unified technical vision
- coherent early architecture
- a clear point of responsibility

While the project is young, this model keeps decision-making efficient and
focused.

**All decisions are transparent and versioned through GitHub issues, pull
requests, specs, and releases.**

---

# 4. Transition to a Formal Organization (OSBL / Cooperative)

As CivicPress grows, stewardship will transition from a single maintainer to an
**independent legal entity** to guarantee long-term neutrality and public trust.

Two models are planned for evaluation:

## **A. OSBL (Non-Profit Organization)**

A non-profit structure ensures:

- independence from any private vendor
- transparent financial management
- eligibility for grants and public funding
- long-term stewardship of the platform

This model is common in major open-source projects (Linux Foundation, Mozilla
Foundation, OpenStreetMap Foundation).

## **B. Municipal Cooperative (Town-Owned Digital Infrastructure)**

A cooperative model where participating municipalities become members:

- each member town has a vote
- shared funding of common improvements
- shared ownership of civic digital infrastructure
- collaborative governance across regions

This option aligns strongly with digital sovereignty and public-sector
collaboration.

**The final organizational model will be chosen based on the needs of early
pilot municipalities and contributors.**

---

# 5. Future Governance Structure (Planned v1.0+)

When the OSBL/coop is created, CivicPress will transition to a multi-layer
governance system:

## **1. Board of Directors**

Responsible for:

- strategic direction
- budget allocation
- long-term stewardship

Includes representatives from:

- municipal partners
- technical maintainers
- civic/academic advisors
- community representatives

## **2. Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**

Maintains:

- the architecture
- security policies
- module API and specifications
- the release cycle

Members are nominated from active contributors with proven expertise.

## **3. Contributor Community**

Open to:

- developers
- designers
- clerks
- archivists
- accessibility experts
- translators

Contributors gain influence through active participation, issue triage, PRs, and
community discussions.

## **4. Municipal Advisory Council**

Comprised of clerks, DGs, archivists, and civic administrators.

Responsibilities:

- ensure CivicPress remains usable for real local governments
- identify administrative needs
- review workflow features
- validate accessibility and record-keeping requirements

---

# 6. Decision-Making Process

### **Short Term (v0.1–0.3)**

Maintainer-led, with decisions tracked through GitHub:

- Issues → discussion
- Pull requests → review
- Specs → approval

Transparent, collaborative, and open to all contributors.

### **Medium Term (v0.4–0.9)**

Hybrid governance:

- Maintainer + early municipal partners
- More formal review process
- Lightweight RFC system for large features
- Quarterly roadmap updates

### **Long Term (v1.0+)**

Governance shifts to the organization:

- Board oversight
- TSC technical approval
- Contributor voting for major changes
- Municipal Advisory Council for civic-impact features

---

# 7. How Decisions Are Logged

All governance actions are recorded publicly:

- Project roadmap ([docs/roadmap.md](roadmap.md))
- GitHub issues + discussions
- Pull request reviews
- Architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Release notes and changelog ([CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md))
- Governance meeting minutes (future OSBL)

Municipalities evaluating the platform can always trace how and why decisions
were made.

---

# 8. Code of Conduct (Summary)

CivicPress adopts a standard, respectful Code of Conduct based on major
open-source projects.

Key requirements:

- Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive
- No harassment or discriminatory behavior
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Follow maintainers’ guidance during conflict

# 10. Evolution of This Document
