# Workflow Configuration

CivicPress supports configurable governance workflows through YAML configuration
files. This allows cities and organizations to define their own approval
processes, role-based permissions, and status transitions.

## Quick Start

The basic workflow configuration is located at `data/.civic/workflows.yml`. This
file defines:

- **Statuses**: The different states a record can be in
- **Transitions**: Which status changes are allowed
- **Roles**: Who can perform which actions

## Basic Configuration

Here's a simple configuration that works for most cities:

```yaml
statuses:
  - draft
  - approved
  - archived

transitions:
  draft: [approved]
  approved: [archived]
  archived: []

roles:
  clerk:
    can_transition:
      draft: [approved]
      any: [archived]
  public:
    can_view: [bylaw, policy, resolution]
```

This creates a simple workflow:

1. Records start as `draft`
2. Clerks can approve drafts
3. Anyone can archive approved records
4. Public can view all record types

## Advanced Examples

### Multi-Step Approval Process

For cities that need more control:

```yaml
statuses:
  - draft
  - proposed
  - reviewed
  - approved
  - archived

transitions:
  draft: [proposed]
  proposed: [reviewed, archived]
  reviewed: [approved, archived]
  approved: [archived]
  archived: []

roles:
  clerk:
    can_transition:
      draft: [proposed]
      proposed: [reviewed]
  council:
    can_transition:
      reviewed: [approved]
      any: [archived]
  public:
    can_view: [bylaw, policy, resolution]
```

### Department-Specific Workflows

Different rules for different record types:

```yaml
recordTypes:
  bylaw:
    statuses: [draft, proposed, reviewed, approved, archived]
    transitions:
      draft: [proposed]
      proposed: [reviewed, archived]
      reviewed: [approved, archived]
      approved: [archived]
      archived: []
  policy:
    statuses: [draft, approved, archived]
    transitions:
      draft: [approved]
      approved: [archived]
      archived: []

roles:
  legal_dept:
    can_transition:
      draft: [proposed]
      proposed: [reviewed]
  council:
    can_transition:
      reviewed: [approved]
      any: [archived]
  public:
    can_view: [bylaw, policy, resolution]
```

## Configuration Options

### Statuses

Define the possible states for records:

```yaml
statuses:
  - draft
  - proposed
  - reviewed
  - approved
  - archived
```

### Transitions

Define which status changes are allowed:

```yaml
transitions:
  draft: [proposed]           # draft can become proposed
  proposed: [reviewed, archived]  # proposed can become reviewed or archived
  reviewed: [approved, archived]  # reviewed can become approved or archived
  approved: [archived]        # approved can become archived
  archived: []                # archived is final state
```

### Roles

Define who can do what:

```yaml
roles:
  clerk:
    can_transition:
      draft: [proposed]       # clerk can move draft → proposed
      proposed: [reviewed]    # clerk can move proposed → reviewed
    can_create: [bylaw, policy, resolution]  # clerk can create these types
    can_edit: [bylaw, policy, resolution]    # clerk can edit these types
  council:
    can_transition:
      reviewed: [approved]    # council can move reviewed → approved
      any: [archived]         # council can archive from any status
    can_create: [bylaw, policy, resolution]
    can_edit: [bylaw, policy, resolution]
  public:
    can_view: [bylaw, policy, resolution]    # public can only view
```

## Role Permissions

Each role can have these permissions:

- `can_transition`: What status changes they can make
- `can_create`: What record types they can create
- `can_edit`: What record types they can edit
- `can_delete`: What record types they can delete
- `can_view`: What record types they can view

## Special Keywords

- `any`: Used in transitions to mean "from any status"
- `*`: Used in permissions to mean "all record types"

## CLI Integration

The workflow configuration is automatically used by CLI commands:

```bash
# Change status (validates against workflow config)
civic status my-bylaw approved --role clerk

# Create record (validates permissions)
civic create bylaw "New Bylaw" --role clerk

# View record (validates permissions)
civic view my-bylaw --role public
```

## Validation

CivicPress validates all actions against the workflow configuration:

1. **Status Transitions**: Only allowed transitions are permitted
2. **Role Permissions**: Only authorized roles can perform actions
3. **Record Types**: Only allowed record types can be created/edited

If validation fails, you'll see clear error messages explaining what's not
allowed.

## Default Configuration

If no `workflows.yml` file exists, CivicPress uses these defaults:

- **Statuses**: draft, proposed, reviewed, approved, archived
- **Transitions**: Simple linear progression
- **Roles**: clerk, council, public with basic permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Use the basic configuration for most cities
2. **Document Your Process**: Make sure your workflow matches your actual
   approval process
3. **Test Changes**: Always test workflow changes before deploying
4. **Role Clarity**: Define clear roles that match your organization structure
5. **Audit Trail**: All status changes are logged with role information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid transition"**: Check that the transition is defined in your config
2. **"Role not found"**: Make sure the role exists in your configuration
3. **"Cannot perform action"**: Check role permissions for the specific action

### Debugging

Use the `--dry-run` flag to test changes without making them:

```bash
civic status my-bylaw approved --role clerk --dry-run
```

This will show you what would happen without actually changing the record.
