# CivicPress Full-Stack Security & Quality Audit — 2026-07-02

**Date:** 2026-07-02 **Repos:** monorepo `civicpress` @
`refactor/phase-5-broadcast-box-server` (tip `a83a340`) + hardware repo
`civicpress-broadcast-box` @ `refactor/phase-4-enrollment-hardening` (local-only
per the origin/main freeze) **Anchor master plan:**
`docs/plans/2026-05-17-base-refactor-master-plan.md` §4/§5 **Prior registry:**
`docs/audits/2026-05-16-manifesto-fit-findings.md` (the 205-finding
manifesto-fit audit) **Prior reports:** `docs/audits/phase-2a … phase-5` closure
reports **Convention:** `docs/plans/finding-tracking-convention.md` **Author:**
Claude (Fable 5), commissioned by the maintainer **Threat model:** CivicPress
API + UI are **internet-exposed** (public municipal transparency portal); the
BroadcastBox appliance sits on the **town-hall LAN** and dials out to the
server; a hostile actor may be on that LAN and the device↔server link may cross
untrusted networks; a malicious/compromised server is in scope for device-side
findings.

## Summary

This is a fresh, full-depth audit of the entire CivicPress surface — the base
platform (core, API, CLI, UI, storage), the reintroduced BroadcastBox server
module + protocol + transcription service, and the Python hardware appliance —
commissioned mid-refactor to find security gaps and improvement opportunities
before the origin/main unfreeze.

**Verdict: the base-refactor spine is holding — most of the 2026-05
manifesto-fit findings that were closed are genuinely closed (verified: storage
quotas enforced, failover probing real, cloud SDKs optional, DOMPurify wired,
the `@nuxt/ui-pro` vendor-lock removed from the monorepo UI, notifications
honesty restored). But the new work re-opened real ground, and several long-tail
base issues were never closed.** This audit confirms **4 Critical, 22 High, 40
Medium, and 16 Low** findings after adversarial verification (each Critical/High
was independently re-checked by two skeptical verifiers; a number of candidate
issues were **refuted or downgraded** and are recorded as such so the registry
stays honest).

The through-line is the refactor's own spine — _make truth true_: the most
dangerous findings are places where a **control that appears to exist does not
actually protect the thing it names**. The clerk's "in-camera" button does not
stop the camera. The "encryption at rest" stores the key next to the ciphertext.
`helmet`/`express-rate-limit` are installed but never wired. A "private" storage
folder is readable by the anonymous public. `validateTransition` guards one of
four status-write paths. These are not merely bugs; on a Trust/Transparency
platform they are trust theatre, and they are the report's priority.

### The four Criticals (headline)

1. **`FA-API-001` — Unauthenticated remote admin takeover.**
   `POST /api/v1/auth/simulated` is on the public (no-auth) router and gated
   only by `if (NODE_ENV === 'production')`. In a default deployment where
   `NODE_ENV` is unset, any anonymous remote user can
   `POST {"username":"x","role":"admin"}` and receive a **real admin bearer
   token**. Full auth+authz bypass. (Independently found twice — `V1` and `D6` —
   both survived 2/2 escalation.)
2. **`FA-BB-002` — Closed-session (in-camera) VIDEO is publicly downloadable.**
   The device never stops recording when a clerk toggles _in-camera_; the **full
   MP4 including the closed window** is uploaded to a storage folder marked
   `access: 'public'`, and `GET /api/v1/storage/files/:id` serves public-folder
   bytes **without auth**. Only the _transcript_ excludes in-camera. Amplified
   by `FA-STOR-001`, an unauthenticated endpoint that **enumerates every
   recording's UUID**, so no record needs to be published and no UUID needs
   guessing. This is a direct violation of the platform's core privacy promise
   and of municipal open-meeting law.
3. **`FA-BB-001` — Any enrolled device can rewrite another session's capture
   block.** `session.manifest` is applied to the device-supplied `session_id`
   with **no check that the sending device owns that session**. A single
   compromised/rogue enrolled appliance can reclassify another meeting's
   in-camera segments as `public`, causing the server to transcribe and publish
   closed-session audio, or bind a forged recording to a session.
4. **`FA-HW-001` — Device config API is unauthenticated on `0.0.0.0`.** "AP
   mode" never actually creates an access point (no `hostapd`/`dnsmasq`); the
   FastAPI config server binds all interfaces on plain HTTP with no auth,
   exposing the enrollment code, live camera preview, factory reset, and Wi-Fi
   password to any host on the town-hall LAN — and lets an attacker **repoint
   the device at their own server**.

### Master-plan exit-criteria — honest assessment

| Criterion                                                                             | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base refactor (Phase 2a–2d) closed the 20 Critical + structural findings              | **MOSTLY TRUE** — verified closures are real; but `api-005` (no rate-limit/headers) and the `ui-003` SSR half remain **open**, and this audit surfaces new Criticals not in the 2026-05 registry.                                                                    |
| Phase 3 (realtime) reintroduced Yjs-only, excised device legacy                       | **TRUE** — the `realtime-001…004` findings are stale (they describe the old paused server); the new device-room code is cleaner, though it carries the `FA-BB-001` manifest-trust gap.                                                                               |
| Phase 4/5 (BroadcastBox) "device→record→transcript, in-camera excluded, proven blank" | **PARTIAL / MISLEADING** — the _transcript_ exclusion is real, but the **video is not redacted and is public** (`FA-BB-002`). The closure language "in-camera proven blank" is true of the transcript only and should be corrected to avoid overclaim.               |
| "All `broadcast-box-*` findings closed/hardened"                                      | **PARTIAL** — the 15 claimed closures largely verify (streaming upload, uuid room-keying, one-time codes, whisper `spawn`, fail-closed operator auth), but the enrollment code is **not bound to the device UUID** (`FA-BB-004`), undercutting the BB-HW-013 intent. |

**Ledger (reconciled):** 205 findings (20C/65H/79M/41L). **Criticals: 20/20

1 wontfix.** Medium+Low tail: largely untouched by design. Still-open High
themes the refactor has not resolved: the CLI safety/UX tail (`cli-002…006`),
the UI analytics-injection + config-drift (`ui-004/006/007`), storage
resilience/sanitization (`storage-005/007/008`), workspace hygiene + sensitive
data at rest (`workspace-002/004/005`), sibling-repo de-scoping never formalized
(`ingest-*`, `site-004`), and functional-claim stubs still shipping (`core-002`,
`api-005/006`).

## Method

Two-stage. **(1) Map:** six parallel readers built architecture + security maps
of core, API+auth, UI, the BroadcastBox server, and the Python device, plus a
conventions/ledger reconciliation. **(2) Verify + deepen:** a 24-task workflow
read the actual code for every candidate — 14 grouped verification tasks across
both repos, 6 cross-cutting deep traces (privacy chain, path-traversal
reachability, DDL-injection reachability, saga integrity, publication authz, and
the NODE_ENV-unset bypass matrix), and 4 gap-fillers (storage, CLI,
dependencies, completeness). **Every Critical/High finding was re-checked by two
independent adversarial verifiers** — one for reachability in a default
production deployment, one hunting for a compensating control. 36 agents, ~1.3M
tokens.

**Refuted / downgraded (kept honest):** the `record-manager` `relativePath`
traversal is **not remotely reachable** (no API route binds it — downgraded to a
defense-in-depth core hardening item); the core `migrations.ts` DDL sites use
**hardcoded identifiers** (refuted; only the admin-gated diagnostics auto-fix is
injectable); the backup-restore zip-slip is **CLI-only, admin-triggered** with
`node-tar` protections (refuted as remotely exploitable); the `RoleManager`
unknown-role fallback is **fail-_safe_** to least-privilege, not fail-open; the
`mock-` token and OAuth test bypasses require `NODE_ENV==='test'` and are
**inactive** when unset; `config.ts`'s fail-open gate is **unreachable**;
`system.ts` exposes only UI-needed record-type metadata;
`notifications-002/003/006`, `storage-001/004/006`, and `deps-006/007`
(axios/h3) are **genuinely fixed**; no committed secrets were found.

## Findings — Critical

Effort: **S** ≤ ½ day · **M** ~1–3 days · **L** > 3 days / cross-cutting.

### FA-API-001 · Critical · S · **closed** (`da2ff38`, branch `refactor/phase-6-audit-remediation-criticals`) · Unauthenticated admin-session minting via `POST /api/v1/auth/simulated`

`modules/api/src/routes/auth.ts:239-307` mounts `/simulated` on the public auth
router (`index.ts:277-285`, no `authMiddleware`). The only guard is
`if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') return 403` (`auth.ts:240`). The
body `{username, role}` is validated only by `isValidRole` (`admin` passes); it
calls `authenticateWithSimulatedAccount`
(`core/src/auth/auth-service/oauth-ops.ts:267-303`), which persists a real DB
user at the requested role and returns a **real session token — no credential
required**. With `NODE_ENV` unset (the realistic default) the guard is false and
the endpoint is live. **Impact:** complete unauthenticated auth + privilege
escalation to admin (read/write all records incl. closed-session material, user
management), plus a persistent backdoor user. **Fix:** fail-closed — enable only
when `NODE_ENV==='development'|'test'` **and** an explicit opt-in flag
(`CIVIC_ALLOW_SIMULATED_AUTH`); never treat unset as non-production. Prefer not
mounting the route at all absent the dev flag. **Fixed (shipped `da2ff38`):**
new core helper `isSimulatedAuthEnabled()` — allowed only under `NODE_ENV==='test'`
or `NODE_ENV==='development'` **with** `CIVIC_ALLOW_SIMULATED_AUTH=true`; unset /
`production` / anything else denied. Enforced in the API route, the CLI twin
(`FA-CLI-001`), and core `authenticateWithSimulatedAccount` (throws) as a
defense-in-depth backstop. Tests: 6 policy unit cases + API 403 cases for both
unset `NODE_ENV` and `production`.

### FA-BB-002 · Critical · L · Closed-session (in-camera) video recorded, uploaded, and served publicly unauthenticated

End-to-end trace (both repos, all links verified):

- **Device** — `command_handler.py:1155-1187` (`set_visibility('in_camera')`)
  only publishes an event; the sole consumer (`upload_coordinator.py:112-119`)
  appends a timestamp. **Nothing pauses/blanks/stops the encoder.** The full MP4
  is uploaded (`upload_coordinator.py:121-160`); the in-camera "exclusion" is a
  best-effort `segments` hint in `session.manifest` that is **lost if the socket
  is down** (`session_manifest_emitter.py:78-85`).
- **Server** — the recording is stored with `folder:'recordings'`
  (`upload-processor.ts:249`), which is `access:'public'` in both merged config
  and the `getDefaultConfig()` fallback (`storage-config-manager.ts:45-51`).
  `GET /api/v1/storage/files/:id` runs under `optionalAuth` and serves the bytes
  when the folder is public and `!req.user` (`single-file-handlers.ts:290-304`).
  **No server-side video redaction exists** — `applySessionManifest` only writes
  `segments` into metadata, and the transcription worker (`worker.ts:41-101`)
  uses them to exclude in-camera from the **transcript only**. **Impact:**
  legally-privileged closed-session A/V (personnel, litigation, land/labour) is
  captured in full and is downloadable by any unauthenticated remote user. The
  transcript exclusion is security theatre — it hides the words while the raw
  video of the same segment stays public. Directly reachable in default prod, no
  `NODE_ENV` dependency. **Fix (defense in depth):** (1) **device-side hard
  gate** — `set_visibility('in_camera')` must signal the encoder to stop/split
  so closed A/V is never written or uploaded (strongest; immune to a dropped
  manifest); **or** (2) **server-side physical redaction** — cut the in-camera
  ranges out of the stored MP4 before exposure, and default a recording with
  unknown segments to _not public_. **Immediate stopgap (S):** change
  `recordings.access` from `'public'` to `'authenticated'`/`'private'` and
  require a permission on `storage:download` — but this alone still exposes
  closed A/V to any logged-in `storage:download` holder, so it must be paired
  with (1) or (2). This finding is the collision between the intentional "A/V
  always public" architecture decision and the in-camera feature: the closed
  window must be exempted from "always public."

### FA-BB-001 · Critical · M · `session.manifest` has no device-ownership check (cross-session capture tampering)

`device-room-handler.ts` (~567-613) reads `payload.session_id` +
`payload.capture` from an authenticated device and calls
`sessionController.applySessionManifest(sessionId, capture)`; the authenticated
`deviceAuth.deviceId` is **never passed down or compared**
(`session-controller.ts:552-596` writes `metadata.capture` as system-admin
`{id:1,role:'admin'}` to whatever session the device names). **Impact:** a
single compromised/rogue enrolled device (realistic on the hostile LAN per the
threat model, or via a stolen enrollment credential) can send `session.manifest`
for **any** `session_id` and overwrite `capture.segments`, reclassifying
in-camera windows as `public` — the transcription worker then transcribes and
publishes closed-session audio — or overwrite `av_file` to bind a forged
recording. Cross-tenant auth bypass on a Trust-critical write. **Fix:** pass
`deviceAuth.deviceId` into `applySessionManifest`; look up the broadcast session
and reject unless its `deviceId` matches the authenticated device; validate
`segment.visibility` against the enum and reject unknown session ids.

### FA-HW-001 · Critical · M · Device config API binds `0.0.0.0` unauthenticated (LAN takeover of enrollment credentials)

`web_server.py:103-109` binds uvicorn `0.0.0.0:8443` plain HTTP; `:59-65` sets
CORS `allow_origins=['*'] allow_credentials=True`; **no auth dependency on any
route**. Crucially `ap_mode/service.py::activate()` starts only the web server —
there is **no `hostapd`/`dnsmasq`/wlan setup anywhere** — so "AP mode" is a
misnomer that listens on the wired town-hall LAN. Any LAN host can
`GET /api/config` / `/api/enrollment/info` (enrollment code + `civicpress_url`
in plaintext) and `POST /api/config` to overwrite
`civicpress_url`/`device_uuid`/`enrollment_code`. **Impact:** an unauthenticated
LAN attacker reads the pairing secret and **repoints the device at an
attacker-controlled server**, MITMing all meeting A/V (including future closed
sessions), or enrolls a rogue device with the stolen one-time code. **Fix:**
bind to the AP-interface IP or `127.0.0.1`; add a mandatory device-generated
token (shown on local console/QR) enforced on every `/api` route;
`allow_credentials=False`; never return the enrollment code once enrolled.

A process death between the SQLite write (step 1) and git commit (step 3) leaves SQLite and git **permanently divergent**, with the saga row stuck `executing`.                                                              | core-004                     |

## Cross-cutting themes

1. **"Unset `NODE_ENV` = development" is the single most dangerous systemic
   pattern.** It turns a Critical (`FA-API-001`) and a High (`FA-CLI-001`)
   live-by-default and leaves `BYPASS_AUTH` (`FA-API-002`) one env-var from full
   bypass. **One fix pays for several:** treat unset `NODE_ENV` as production
   everywhere a dev/test path is gated, and require an explicit positive opt-in
   (`CIVIC_DEV_MODE=1`) for every simulated/mock/bypass path.
2. **The device is trusted where it is only semi-trusted.** `session_id`,
   `fileName`, `av_file`, the RTMP `url`, `update_config` keys, and
   `session.manifest` ownership all accept unvalidated data crossing the trust
   boundary (`FA-BB-001/003`, `FA-HW-006/007/008`). Add input validation + an
   ownership check + allowlists at every device↔server ingress; the wire schema
   validates envelopes but explicitly _not_ payload contents.
3. **"A/V always public" collides with in-camera privacy.** The intentional
   architecture decision is right for genuinely-public meeting A/V but must
   **exempt the closed window** — which today is carved out of the transcript
   but not the video (`FA-BB-002`, `FA-STOR-001`). This is the report's headline
   and should gate the Phase-5 sign-off.
4. **The internet-exposed API has no hardening floor.** No rate limiting, no
   security headers, no lockout, no CSP (`FA-API-006/007`, `FA-UI-001`). These
   are installed-but-unwired or absent; wiring them is low-effort, high-value.
5. **Authorization is per-route and inconsistent.** A new unguarded router is
   public by default; geography is unguarded (`FA-API-003`), status-transition
   is checked on one of four paths (`FA-API-008`), and `private` storage =
   `authenticated` (`FA-STOR-002`). Consider a default-deny posture +
   centralizing status/transition + storage-folder authz.
6. **Secrets at rest, in transit, and in logs.** Device key beside ciphertext in
   a world-readable DB (`FA-HW-004/005`), cleartext transport defaults
   (`FA-HW-009`), and stream-keys/raw-frames in logs (`FA-BB-009/010`,
   `FA-HW-013`).
7. **Transactional integrity has real correctness gaps** — no crash recovery,
   short lock TTL, inert idempotency, partial compensation
   (`FA-CORE-001/006-010`). On a platform whose manifesto makes git the source
   of truth, DB↔git divergence is a Trust defect.

## Recommendations

### Security (priority order)

1. **Fail-closed the dev/auth switches** (`FA-API-001`, `FA-CLI-001`,
   `FA-API-002`) — treat unset `NODE_ENV` as prod; gate simulated/mock/bypass
   behind explicit opt-in. _Highest leverage, S-effort._
2. **Stop publishing closed-session video** (`FA-BB-002`) — device-side capture
   gating or server-side redaction; stopgap: make `recordings` non-public + fix
   folder enumeration (`FA-STOR-001`). _Headline._
3. **Bind device trust** — `session.manifest` ownership (`FA-BB-001`),
   enrollment-code↔UUID (`FA-BB-004`), sanitize `session_id`/`fileName`/RTMP
   scheme/`update_config` allowlist (`FA-HW-006/007/008`, `FA-BB-003`).
4. **Lock down the device LAN surface** — auth + interface-bind the config API;
   gate on unenrolled (`FA-HW-001/002/003/010`); harden creds at rest
   (`FA-HW-004/005`); enforce a TLS floor (`FA-HW-009`).
5. **Wire the hardening floor** — `helmet` + `express-rate-limit` + account
   lockout + CSP (`FA-API-006/007`, `FA-UI-001`).
6. **Fix the authz gaps** — geography (`FA-API-003`), status-transition
   centralization (`FA-API-008`), private-folder access (`FA-STOR-002`), the two
   path-traversal reads (`FA-API-005/012`).

### Architecture

- **Centralize authorization.** Move `validateTransition` into
  `RecordManager.updateRecord`/`publishDraft` so no API path can skip it; adopt
  a default-deny mount posture (a router without an explicit guard should 500,
  not serve). Retire the log-only `WorkflowEngine` stubs (`core-002`) or wire
  them as the real enforcement point.
- **Make the device↔server contract validate payloads, not just envelopes.** The
  canonical schema is a genuine win; extend per-action payload schemas (or
  server-side validators) so the "payloads are the device's problem" gap
  (`FA-BB-001/003`) closes structurally.
- **Finish the saga story or simplify it.** Either add the `SagaRecovery`
  driver + fix lock TTL/idempotency (`FA-CORE-001/006-010`), or, if full 2-phase
  saga semantics aren't needed for a single-node git+SQLite write, consider a
  simpler write-ahead+reconcile approach — the current half-built saga
  infrastructure is complexity without the safety it implies.
- **Storage access model.** Introduce a real `private`/`authenticated`/`public`
  distinction with distinct permissions, and carve A/V "always public" to
  exclude closed segments.
- **God-objects.** `record-manager.ts` (939), `record-parser.ts` (823), and the
  HW `command_handler.py` (2412) remain large; continue the Phase-2d
  decomposition into these.

### Tech stack

- **Keep the wins:** opaque-token auth (not JWT) is fine and parameterized
  SQLite is safe; the `@nuxt/ui` v4 (MIT) migration correctly resolved `ui-002`
  — **but reunify the hardware `frontend/` off `@nuxt/ui-pro`** (`FA-DEP-005`).
- **Pin dependencies.** Add a Python lockfile + hashes to the appliance
  (`FA-DEP-004`); bump `nodemailer`/`js-yaml` (`FA-DEP-001/002`). All 44
  `pnpm audit --prod` advisories are dominated by build-time `node-tar` (low
  risk) + `nodemailer` (fix).
- **CSP + security headers** are absent across both the API and the SPA; add
  them as a stack-level default.

### DX

- **The `NODE_ENV` default is a DX trap** — a clerk/CI host that forgets to set
  it silently enables admin backdoors. Make the safe path the default and log
  loudly on any dev-mode activation.
- **Guard destructive CLI** — `cleanup --force` needs a real confirmation (typed
  install name, not the constant `"civicpress"`), and `--token` should be
  replaced by `--token-file`/`CIVIC_TOKEN` (`FA-CLI-002/003`).
- **Appliance install** — `docker/` is still empty; the bring-up is a manual
  `git clone` + shell script + `systemd` with no signed image or firewall for
  `:8443`. A reproducible image (pinned, integrity-checked) closes both a DX and
  a supply-chain gap.
- **Fix the tracking drift** (`FA-OPS-001`) — re-tally the registry Snapshot and
  refresh `project-status.md`/`roadmap.md`; the flaky pre-commit suite (per
  project memory) should be repaired so `--no-verify` stops being routine.

### UI/UX

- **Remove the analytics `<script>` re-execution** (`FA-UI-001`) — render
  analytics via a strict allow-list or a nonce'd CSP, never
  `innerHTML`+`createElement('script')`; move JWT out of `localStorage` toward
  an `httpOnly` cookie or in-memory token to blunt XSS token theft.
- **Delete the shipped `setMockUser()` admin backdoor** (`stores/auth.ts:271`)
  from the bundle.
- **Finish `ui-003`** — the `<noscript>` fallback is thoughtful, but public
  records should be server-rendered/crawlable (SSR or prerender) so the
  transparency portal works without JS; add a service worker for the
  offline/resilience promise.
- **Config-driven presentation** — record type/status **icons and colors** are
  still hardcoded (`useIcons.ts`, `useRecordTypes.ts`), so custom municipal
  vocab renders generic; and several admin/config pages remain
  hardcoded-English.
- **Accessibility** — ~6 `alt` / 37 `aria-*` across ~120 components is thin for
  a public-sector (WCAG/AODA) portal; budget an a11y pass.

## Carry-forward — not audited this pass (recommend follow-up)

- `core/src/indexing` rebuild logic (FTS injection / `rebuild=true` resource
  exhaustion).
- `modules/api/src/routes/config.ts` value reflection/sanitization beyond the
  traversal sink.
- `core/src/search` FTS5 index-fix + query-builder beyond `FA-CORE-003`.
- Geography `generateFilename(name,…)` — confirm it strips `/`/`..` now that any
  user can reach it (`FA-API-003`).
- `POST /sessions/quick-start` + `GET /sessions/by-meeting/:id` authz (the
  Phase-5 create-on-demand path).
- The `e2e/broadcast-box-live` harness logic (reviewed for secrets only).
- **Phase 4/5 closure claims asserted-not-independently-verified here:**
  "transcript excluding in-camera — proven blank, zero leak" (harness-asserted;
  note `FA-BB-002` shows the _video_ is not blank), the uuid-room-keying fix,
  and the real-hardware capstone. Validate via the broadcast-box sub-audit
  rather than assume closed.

## Anti-deletion check

No finding was removed from `docs/audits/2026-05-16-manifesto-fit-findings.md`.
This report is a **new findings registry** (`FA-*` prefix) per the
finding-tracking convention's "future audits append a new file" rule. Where a
new finding is a still-open instance or regression of a prior one, the **Old
ref** column links it (e.g. `FA-API-006` ⟶ `api-005`, `FA-STOR-001` ⟶
over-corrected `storage-002`, `FA-DEP-005` ⟶ `ui-002` in the HW repo). Prior
findings this audit **verified as genuinely closed** — `storage-001/004/006`,
`notifications-002/003/006`, `deps-006/007`, `core-001`, the markdown-XSS
`ui-001`, and `ui-002` (monorepo) — should have their tracker rows confirmed
`closed`, not reopened.

## Status tracker (this registry)

All `FA-*` findings default to `open`. None are closed yet. Next actions per the
convention: triage `FA-API-001`, `FA-BB-002`, `FA-BB-001`, `FA-HW-001` (the
Criticals) first, branch `refactor/phase-6-audit-remediation-*`, and close with
`closes: FA-...` commit footers.

## Sign-off

This audit is **advisory input to the origin/main unfreeze**, not a closure. The
base refactor's verified closures hold and the BroadcastBox engineering is
substantially complete — but **4 Critical findings (one of them, `FA-BB-002`, a
direct violation of the platform's central privacy promise) and 22 High findings
are open**, several of them in the newly-added surface. Per the standing freeze,
nothing pushes to `origin/main` until these land and a confirming re-audit is
clean. The honest read: the refactor made the base true; the new work now needs
the same treatment before it goes public.

## Addendum — live real-hardware capstone (2026-07-03)

A real BroadcastBox appliance (BOSGAME E3 / Intel N150, Razer Kiyo Pro + MS2131
HDMI dongle) was brought up and driven **end-to-end against a live CivicPress
dev server**. This validated the integration and surfaced five new findings: one
server-side (`FA-API-023`, fixed) and four device-side capture-pipeline bugs
(`FA-HW-014/015/016/017`, **all fixed 2026-07-03**, see below). With those
closed, a full meeting now records → uploads → becomes a civic record +
transcript on real hardware — which in turn let `FA-BB-002` be **confirmed
live** rather than inferred.

**Proven working live on real hardware:** appliance install + hardware H.264
(VAAPI) encode; device enrollment against CivicPress (real token);
device↔CivicPress WebSocket connection; full command round-trip with ACKs
(`sources.set`, `preview.start`, `start_session`, `set_visibility`
in-camera/public, `stop_session`); CivicPress session-record lifecycle (draft →
recording → stopping → **complete**); device capability reporting; and — after
the fixes below — **a headless `sources.set` → `quick-start` → in-camera toggle
→ `stop` capturing 1080p VAAPI A/V, uploading, and producing a `session` record
with a capture block (public/in-camera/public segments) plus an automated WebVTT
transcript that excludes the in-camera window.** Encoder **detection is
correct** (selects Intel QuickSync/`h264_vaapi`, not the Pi `h264_v4l2m2m`).

### FA-API-023 · High · S · `security`/`correctness` · **closed-with-commit-`8f6a791`** · In-process broadcast-box HTTP API was 404-shadowed on the real server

`modules/api/src/index.ts` registered `notFoundHandler` + `errorHandler` in
`initialize()` (before `app.listen()`), but broadcast-box mounts its
device/session/upload routers in `start()` (after `listen()`, so the realtime WS
server can be bridged in). Express matches middleware in registration order, so
the catch-all 404 shadowed **every** broadcast-box HTTP route — enrollment,
sessions, and uploads all returned 404 on a normally-deployed server. It only
ever worked in the `e2e/broadcast-box-live` / `broadcast-box-mount-e2e`
harnesses, which build the Express app without a 404 handler — a "green tests,
dead in prod" gap. **Fix (shipped):** register the 404/error handlers at the END
of `start()`, after `startBroadcastBox()`; added two regression tests pinning
the ordering. This is why the closure report's "proven end-to-end hardware-free"
did not catch it — the harness constructs the app differently from the real
entrypoint.

### FA-HW-014 · High · M · `correctness` · **closed** (BroadcastBox `12508ab`) · `start_session` ignores `sources.set`; capture only starts from a PiP layout or a running preview

`main.py:497` `handle_session_start` builds `video_sources` **only** from
`get_pip_layout()` (`:519-523`) or an already-running preview (`:567-597`) — it
never reads the single-camera source that `sources.set` persisted to
`session_defaults`. So an API-driven `start_session` without a prior
`preview.start` logs "No video sources available or FFmpeg capture service not
available" and records nothing (the CivicPress session then hangs in `stopping`,
no upload, no capture block, no transcript). The documented single-camera flow
(`sources.set` → `start_session`) does not work unattended. **Fix (shipped):**
when the PiP/preview paths leave the source lists empty, `handle_session_start`
now falls back to `command_handler._get_active_sources()` — the same resolver
that reads `session_defaults` — so a headless `start_session` records.

### FA-HW-015 · High · M · `correctness` · **closed** (BroadcastBox `12508ab`) · Preview→record transition leaves the audio device busy → recording ffmpeg fails

Using a preview to work around FA-HW-014, `start_session` then fails: the
combined recording ffmpeg dies with
**`cannot open audio device plughw:1 (Device or resource busy)`**. The preview's
separate audio ffmpeg holds the Kiyo's ALSA capture device, and the
preview→record transition calls `stop_capture()` on the **video** capture
(`main.py:607`) but does not release the **audio** device. **Fix (shipped):** on
Linux the combined recording process now owns the ALSA device — the separate
audio-preview process is skipped when combined outputs are requested, and the
preview→record transition terminates any surviving audio-preview process before
opening `plughw:N` (macOS AVFoundation still allows the concurrent open and is
unchanged).

### FA-HW-016 · High · M · `correctness` · **closed** (BroadcastBox `12508ab`) · Recording produces no MP4 — dangling rawvideo preview pipe stalls the mux

The combined recording command appended a `rawvideo … pipe:1` preview output
**even when nothing was reading it**; with no consumer, the ~14 MB/s raw-RGB
pipe fills its OS buffer within milliseconds and FFmpeg blocks on the write,
which stalls the MP4 muxer too — the session dir is created but stays empty, so
nothing uploads. (The manual reference command wrote a file precisely because it
had no such pipe.) **Fix (shipped):** request `preview_stream` only when the
preview encoder is actually encoding; a headless session emits a single clean
`-f mp4 <path>`. Two adjacent defects fixed in the same pass: VAAPI `hwupload`
is now chained **inside** `-filter_complex` for watermark/PiP video (FFmpeg
rejects `-vf` alongside `-filter_complex`), and the vainfo parse requires a real
H264 **encode** entrypoint (`VAEntrypointEncSlice`/`…LP`) — a decode-only `VLD`
line no longer marks VAAPI usable, and `-low_power` is added only on
low-power-**only** iGPUs (this box has the full entrypoint, so its recordings
correctly omit the flag).

### FA-HW-017 · High · M · `correctness` · **closed** (BroadcastBox `12508ab`) · Real capture path never triggered an upload (only the synthetic encoder did)

Found once FA-HW-014/015/016 let a recording actually write. The
`UploadCoordinator` enqueues on `encode.unified.stopped` (and anchors segment
`t0` on `encode.unified.started`), but **only the synthetic
`UnifiedEncoderService` published those events** — the real FFmpeg capture path
finalized the MP4 on disk and then silently orphaned it, leaving the CivicPress
session stuck in `stopping` with no capture block. **Fix (shipped):**
`handle_session_start`/`handle_session_stop` publish `encode.unified.started`
(t0 anchor) and `encode.unified.stopped` (with `file_path`/`file_size`/`sha256`)
for the real path, so the existing coordinator → `UploadQueue` →
`session.manifest` chain runs.

### FA-BB-002 — **live-confirmed on real hardware (2026-07-03), remains OPEN**

With the pipeline fixed, a session was driven with a genuine mid-meeting
in-camera window (public 0–24.1 s, **in-camera 24.1–39.2 s**, public 39.2–53.6
s). Result: `GET /api/v1/storage/files/<av_file>` **with no `Authorization`
header** returned **HTTP 200 and the full 13,295,553-byte MP4** (53.03 s,
1920×1080 h264 + 48 kHz AAC); a frame extracted at **t=30 s (inside the closed
window)** decoded fine. The `session` record's `capture.segments` correctly
labels that range `in_camera`, and the automated WebVTT transcript correctly
**excludes** it (one cue, `00:00:00.000 → 00:00:24.097`, ending exactly at the
first public→in-camera boundary). So the finding stands exactly as written:
**the transcript redacts the closed window; the video does not, and it is served
publicly unauthenticated.** This is now demonstrated on real hardware rather
than inferred from code — the redaction gap is device/server-side, unaffected by
the capture-pipeline fixes, and is still the report's headline Critical.

**Net:** the device-app A/V recording pipeline is now **complete and validated
on real hardware** — a meeting records (1080p VAAPI A/V) → uploads → becomes a
`session` civic record with a capture block and an automated transcript that
excludes the in-camera window (FA-HW-014/015/016/017 closed in BroadcastBox
`12508ab`, with an offline regression suite
`tests/unit/test_recording_pipeline.py`). The capstone's remaining open item is
the **privacy** finding, not the plumbing: FA-BB-002 (+ FA-STOR-001 enumeration)
is confirmed live and still gates the Phase-5 sign-off.
