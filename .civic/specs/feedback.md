- Manual review workflows for flagged content
- Appeal process for rejected feedback
- Transparency in moderation decisions

### Access Control & Permissions

- Public read access to approved feedback
- Role-based write access for feedback submission
- Administrative access for feedback moderation and management
- Audit logging of all feedback-related activities
- Granular permissions for feedback review and resolution

## 🔁 Feedback Lifecycle

| Status      | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `submitted` | Submitted by citizen or contributor       |
| `in-review` | Triage started by clerk                   |
| `addressed` | Included in motion, record, or fix        |
| `rejected`  | Considered invalid, abusive, or off-topic |
| `archived`  | Stored but no action taken                |

---

## 🛠️ CLI Commands

```bash
civic feedback submit --title "..." --body "..." --tags noise,safety
civic feedback review noise-complaint.md

```

---

## 🔔 Hook Triggers

- `onFeedbackSubmit` → notify team, tag dashboard
- `onFeedbackReview` → notify related record authors

---

## 🔐 Trust & Moderation

- All feedback is Git-tracked
- Status determines visibility (public by default, filterable by role)
- Reviewers must be listed in `.civic/roles.yml`
- Editors may hide rejected feedback from dashboards but not delete it

---

  status: submitted
  tags: ['noise']
  related_to: ['bylaw-quiet-hours.md']
  submitted_by: 'anonymous'
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Validate index generation and filtering

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
