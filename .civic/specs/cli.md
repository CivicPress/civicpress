## 📛 Name

`cli` — CivicPress Command Line Interface (`civic`)

## 🎯 Purpose

Define the command-line interface used to manage civic records, workflows, and
platform tasks — providing a fast, local-first tool for developers, clerks, and
contributors.

---

## 🧩 Scope & Responsibilities

✅ Responsibilities:

- Scaffold new civic instances (`init`)
- Validate civic records (`lint`)
- Manage Git interactions (propose, approve, publish)
- Sync content or trigger workflows
- Interact with `.civic/`, `records/`, and modules

❌ Out of scope:

- Hosting, deployment, or auth providers
- Real-time editor interface (covered by frontend)

---

## 🧰 Internal Usage (Dogfooding the CLI)

CivicPress is designed to use its own CLI internally — just like a headless CMS
or GitHub using `git`. This ensures:

- 🧪 **Consistency** — UI and automation follow the same rules
- 🔍 **Auditability** — Every change is traceable, role-aware, and Git-committed
- ⚙️ **Composability** — CI, scripts, and modules can call the CLI directly
- 🧩 **Reusability** — The CLI becomes the internal "API surface" of CivicPress

### Examples

| Use Case                               | Internal CLI Command          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Editor saves a bylaw draft             | `civic propose`               |
| GitHub Action publishes after approval | `civic publish`               |
| Feedback hook triggers trace           | `civic trace feedback-001.md` |
| New town setup                         | `civic init --town Richmond`  |

This model ensures CivicPress is **transparent by design**, not by exception.

## 🔧 Core Commands

| Command                | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `civic init`           | Scaffold new CivicPress instance               |
| `civic lint`           | Validate folder structure and frontmatter      |
| `civic propose <file>` | Move draft to `review/` with commit + metadata |
| `civic approve <file>` | Add approval metadata and push                 |
| `civic publish <file>` | Merge to `main` after quorum                   |
| `civic index`          | Rebuild public index (future)                  |
| `civic trace <file>`   | Show full commit history + status              |

---

## 🔌 Integrations

- ✅ Git (via `simple-git` or raw shell)
- ✅ `.civic/roles.yml`, `git-policy.yml`
- ✅ Frontmatter parsing (`gray-matter`)
- ✅ Local file system (`fs`, `glob`)
- 🔄 Hooks + workflows (`hooks/`, `workflows/`)

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Run `civic init` → creates valid structure
- Modify a file → `civic lint` catches bad frontmatter
- Propose → new branch is created with PR-ready commit
- Approve → `approved_by` list is updated
- Publish → triggers workflow + merges cleanly to `main`

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust Considerations

- Only run CLI in Git-tracked CivicPress repo
- Validate all writes against policies in `.civic/`
- All actions logged via Git commits

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- `civic serve` → start local civic dashboard
- `civic build` → compile static civic site
- `civic login` → for auth-bound modules
- Role-aware interactive prompts
- Plugin architecture for custom towns
