# Development Priorities

## Current Priority: Record Creation and Editing Interface ðŸŽ¯

### Immediate Goals
- **Record Creation Form**: Comprehensive form for creating new records with type selection
- **Record Editing Interface**: Full editing capabilities for existing records
- **Template System Integration**: Pre-populate forms with record type templates
- **Status Workflow**: Implement status transitions with validation
- **Rich Text Editor**: Markdown editing with live preview
- **File Upload System**: Attach documents and images to records

### Technical Requirements
- **Form Components**: Reusable form components following user management patterns
- **Validation System**: Client and server-side validation with inline errors
- **API Integration**: Full CRUD operations for records
- **Template Engine**: Use existing template system for pre-population
- **Status Management**: Workflow status transitions with role-based permissions
- **File Management**: Upload, storage, and attachment handling

### UI/UX Standards
- **Consistent Design**: Follow UDashboardPanel patterns established in user management
- **Skeleton Loading**: Use existing skeleton components for loading states
- **Form Validation**: Inline validation with API error toasts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly record forms
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Proper navigation hierarchy

### API Endpoints Needed
- `POST /api/records` - Create new record
- `PUT /api/records/:id` - Update existing record
- `GET /api/templates/:type` - Get record type templates
- `POST /api/records/:id/status` - Change record status
- `POST /api/records/:id/attachments` - Upload files
- `DELETE /api/records/:id/attachments/:fileId` - Remove files

### Development Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Basic create/edit forms with validation
2. **Phase 2**: Template system integration
3. **Phase 3**: Status workflow implementation
4. **Phase 4**: File upload and management
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (auto-save, real-time preview)
