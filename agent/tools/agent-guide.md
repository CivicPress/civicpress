**For**: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, and other AI agents  
**Purpose**: How to effectively use the CivicPress memory system

## üéØ **Quick Start for AI Agents**

### 1. **Initial Context Loading**

When starting work on CivicPress, always read these files first:

```bash
# Essential context files
agent/memory/project-state.md      # Current implementation status
agent/context/goals.md             # Development goals and priorities
agent/memory/architecture.md       # System architecture and patterns
agent/context/blockers.md          # Current blockers and issues

# Critical specifications (read as needed for specific work)
docs/specs/README.md               # Specifications overview and index
docs/specs/manifest.md             # Platform configuration and core principles
docs/specs/api.md                  # REST API design and endpoints
docs/specs/cli.md                  # Command-line interface design
docs/specs/auth.md                 # Authentication and authorization
docs/specs/permissions.md          # Role-based access control
docs/specs/security.md             # Security architecture and requirements
docs/specs/testing-framework.md    # Testing standards and patterns
docs/specs/accessibility.md        # Accessibility requirements
docs/specs/ui.md                   # User interface design patterns
```

### 2. **Session Context**

Check the current session context:

```bash
agent/sessions/current-session.md  # Active session information
```

### 3. **Knowledge Base**

Reference domain knowledge as needed:

```bash
agent/knowledge/patterns.md        # Development patterns
agent/knowledge/references.md      # External resources
agent/knowledge/examples.md        # Code examples
```

## üìã **Memory Update Protocol**

### **Before Starting Work**

1. **Read Project State**: Understand current implementation status
2. **Check Goals**: Review current development priorities
3. **Review Architecture**: Understand system design patterns
4. **Check Blockers**: Be aware of current issues
5. **Reference Specifications**: Read relevant specs for the work area

### **During Work**

1. **Document Decisions**: Update `agent/memory/decisions.md`
2. **Track Progress**: Update `agent/memory/project-state.md`
3. **Record Insights**: Update `agent/memory/lessons.md`
4. **Update Session**: Keep `agent/sessions/current-session.md` current

### **After Completing Work**

1. **Update Project State**: Reflect completed work
2. **Document Lessons**: Record insights and learnings

## üîÑ **Handover Protocol**

When switching between AI agents:

### **Outgoing Agent**

1. **Update Session**: Document current work state
2. **Document Decisions**: Record any new decisions made
3. **Update Progress**: Reflect completed work
4. **Prepare Summary**: Create handover summary

### **Incoming Agent**

1. **Read Handover**: Review handover summary
2. **Load Context**: Read relevant memory files
3. **Verify State**: Confirm current project state
4. **Continue Work**: Resume from where left off

## üìù **Memory Update Guidelines**

### **Project State Updates**

- Update implementation percentages
- Mark completed tasks
- Add new blockers or issues
- Update timeline estimates

### **Decision Documentation**

- **Date**: When decision was made
- **Context**: What led to the decision
- **Options**: What alternatives were considered
- **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
- **Impact**: What this decision affects

### **Lesson Recording**

- **Date**: When lesson was learned
- **Context**: What led to the insight
- **Lesson**: What was learned
- **Application**: How to apply this lesson
- **Category**: Type of lesson (technical, process, etc.)

## üéØ **CivicPress-Specific Guidelines**

### **Specification-Driven Development**

- **Always reference relevant specs before implementation** - The 50+ specs in
  `docs/specs/` are the authoritative source for all design decisions
- **Read specs for your work area** - Check `docs/specs/README.md` for the
  complete index of available specifications
- **Follow specification patterns and conventions** - All implementations should
  align with the comprehensive spec system
- **Update specs if implementation reveals gaps** - Keep specifications current
  with implementation learnings
- **Ensure security and accessibility compliance** - Reference
  `docs/specs/security.md` and `docs/specs/accessibility.md` for all work
