# ðŸ¤– CivicPress Agent Folder (for Developer Memory)

This folder is used by AI companions like Cursor or ChatGPT to persist context,
decisions, and development intent.

It is **not** part of the public CivicPress platform code. Instead, it's used
to:

- Track goals and milestones
- Log open questions or tradeoffs
- Document decisions made with AI input
- Persist memory between coding sessions

## âœ… Why It Exists

AI coding partners are more useful when they can reference consistent, evolving
context. This folder acts as the shared brain between you and your AI
development environment.

Feel free to ignore it if working solo â€” or expand it if using AI tools.
