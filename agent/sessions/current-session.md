- [ ] Build basic hook system
- [ ] Implement Git engine integration
- [ ] Create basic CLI tools
- [ ] Begin legal-register module

## 🧠 **Session Context**

### **Key Decisions Made**

1. **APM Framework Adoption**: Chose to adapt Agentic Project Management
   framework for CivicPress
2. **Memory Structure**: Established comprehensive memory categories (memory,
   context, knowledge, sessions, tools)
3. **AI Agent Focus**: Designed system specifically for AI agent continuity and
   shared understanding
4. **CivicPress Integration**: Tailored memory system to CivicPress's
   specification-driven development approach

### **Insights Gained**

1. **Memory Categories**: Need distinct categories for different types of
   information
2. **Update Protocols**: Clear protocols needed for memory maintenance
3. **AI Agent Guidance**: Specific guidance needed for different AI tools
4. **Handover Process**: Structured handover protocol essential for continuity

### **Challenges Encountered**

1. **Information Organization**: Balancing comprehensive coverage with usability
2. **File Structure**: Ensuring logical organization of memory files
3. **Update Frequency**: Determining appropriate update protocols
4. **AI Agent Differences**: Accommodating different AI tool capabilities

## 📝 **Session Notes**

### **Memory System Design Principles**

- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of project state and context
- **Structured**: Organized categories for different types of information
- **Maintainable**: Clear protocols for updates and maintenance
- **Accessible**: Easy for AI agents to read and understand
- **Valuable**: Focus on information that improves development continuity

### **APM Framework Adaptation**

- **Inspiration**: Agentic Project Management framework provides excellent
  structure
- **Customization**: Adapted for CivicPress's specific needs and context
- **Integration**: Integrated with existing CivicPress documentation and
  specifications
- **Enhancement**: Added CivicPress-specific guidelines and patterns

### **AI Agent Considerations**

- **Diversity**: System must work with Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, and other AI
  tools
- **Capabilities**: Different AI tools have different capabilities and
  limitations
- **Context**: Need to provide appropriate context for each AI tool type
- **Continuity**: Ensure seamless handoffs between different AI agents

## 🔄 **Next Session Preparation**

### **For Next AI Agent**

1. **Read**: All memory files to understand current state
2. **Check**: Session context for active work
3. **Continue**: From where this session left off
4. **Update**: Memory files as work progresses

### **Priority Tasks for Next Session**

1. Start civic-core.ts implementation
2. Build basic hook system (emitHook)
3. Implement Git engine with role-based commits
4. Create basic CLI tools (civic init, civic lint)
5. Begin legal-register module development

## 📊 **Session Metrics**

- **Files Created**: 1 new architecture diagram file, 1 updated git-engine spec
- **Directories Created**: 1 new diagrams directory
- **Time Spent**: ~3 hours
- **Decisions Made**: 1 key decision (Mermaid diagrams)
- **Insights Gained**: Architecture visualization approach
- **Challenges**: Diagram organization and spec formatting

## 🎯 **Session Success Criteria**

- [x] Architecture diagrams created and organized
- [x] Git engine spec properly formatted
- [x] Diagrams integrated with Git Engine
- [x] Mermaid decision documented
- [x] Memory system completed
- [x] Ready for core implementation
- [x] Clear next steps identified
