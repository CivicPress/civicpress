# 💾 Memory Update - 2025-07-18T13:38:12.093Z

## 📊 **Current Status**

Successfully simplified the AI agent handover protocol from a complex 300-line
checklist to a simple "save your memory" command. Created a practical Node.js
tool (`agent/tools/save-memory.js`) that generates a template for agents to fill
in with their session information. The protocol is now 90% shorter and much more
practical for real development sessions.

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

The simplified handover protocol is ready for use. Future agents can simply run
`node agent/tools/save-memory.js` to create a memory template, fill it in with
their session details, and update the memory files as needed. The incoming agent
just needs to read the current session file and acknowledge with "✅ HANDOVER
RECEIVED".

## 📁 **Key Files Modified**

- `agent/tools/handover-protocol.md` - Simplified from 300 lines to ~30 lines
- `agent/tools/save-memory.js` - Created new tool for memory saving
- `agent/memory/decisions.md` - Updated with simplified protocol decision

## 🚧 **Blockers**

None - the simplified handover protocol is complete and functional.
