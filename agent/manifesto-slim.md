# ðŸŒ± CivicPress â€“ Ethos Snapshot (AI Context)

CivicPress is a public infrastructure platform designed to bring transparency,
participation, and trust back to local governance.

It exists to replace opaque, expensive, and fragile government IT systems with
open, modular, Git-native civic software that is accessible, auditable, and
human-centered.
