# Project State

## Current Status: Loading System Complete âœ…

### Recently Completed

- **Comprehensive Loading System**: Fully restored with skeleton components and
  delay middleware
- **User Management Interface**: Complete CRUD operations with role-based access
- **Skeleton Components**: UserCardSkeleton, RecordCardSkeleton, FormSkeleton,
  AvatarSkeleton, DashboardCardSkeleton
- **Delay Middleware**: Configurable API delays for testing loading states
- **Documentation**: Updated user registration docs and agent memory with
  loading system details

### Technical Achievements

- **Loading UX**: Skeleton components provide better perceived performance than
  spinners
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload with configurable API delays for testing
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized loading patterns across all pages
- **Security**: Password fields cleared after submission, proper session
  management
- **API Integration**: Public vs protected endpoints clearly defined

## Next Milestone: Record Creation and Editing Interface ðŸŽ¯

### Target Features

- **Record Creation Form**: Comprehensive form for creating new records
- **Record Editing Interface**: Full editing capabilities for existing records
- **Record Type Support**: Dynamic forms based on record types (bylaw,
  ordinance, policy, etc.)
- **Content Editor**: Rich text editing with markdown support
- **Metadata Management**: Tags, categories, and custom fields
- **Status Management**: Workflow status transitions
- **Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Skeleton Loading**: Use existing skeleton components for loading states

### Technical Requirements

- **Form Components**: Reusable form components for record creation/editing
- **Content Editor**: Markdown editor with preview capabilities
- **File Upload**: Support for attachments and documents
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all record fields
- **API Integration**: Full CRUD operations for records
- **Workflow Integration**: Status transitions and approval processes
- **Skeleton Loading**: Leverage existing skeleton components

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Consistent Design**: Follow established UDashboardPanel patterns
- **Form Validation**: Inline validation with API error toasts
- **Loading States**: Use FormSkeleton and other skeleton components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly record forms
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages and loading indicators

### API Endpoints Needed

- **Record CRUD**: Full create, read, update, delete operations
- **Record Types**: Dynamic record type configuration
- **File Upload**: Attachment handling and storage
- **Validation**: Server-side validation endpoints
- **Workflow**: Status transition and approval endpoints

### Development Approach

- **Incremental Implementation**: Start with basic record creation, then add
  editing
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing form components and patterns
- **Skeleton Integration**: Use existing skeleton components for loading states
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with API delays and skeleton verification
- **Documentation**: Update docs with record management features

## Architecture Status

### âœ… Completed Systems

- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD with admin interface
- **Loading System**: Skeleton components with configurable delays
- **API Structure**: Public vs protected endpoints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and lessons learned

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- **Record Management**: Planning phase for creation/editing interface

### ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **Record Workflows**: Approval processes and status transitions
- **File Management**: Document upload and storage
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced record search capabilities
- **Reporting**: Analytics and reporting features
- **Advanced Roles**: Hierarchical role system

## Development Environment

### Current Setup

- **API Server**: Running on port 3000 with delay middleware
- **UI Server**: Running on port 3030 with hot reload
- **Database**: SQLite with proper schema
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access
- **Loading System**: Skeleton components with 3-second API delays

### Testing Capabilities

- **API Delays**: Configurable delays for testing loading states
- **Skeleton Testing**: Visit pages during delays to verify skeleton components
- **Hot Reload**: UI changes apply immediately without restart
- **Development Mode**: Enhanced logging and debugging features

## Quality Assurance

### Current Standards

- **Code Quality**: TypeScript with proper type safety
- **UI Consistency**: UDashboardPanel patterns across all pages
- **Loading UX**: Skeleton components for better perceived performance
- **Security**: Password security, input validation, proper error handling
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and lessons learned

### Testing Strategy

- **Manual Testing**: API delays for testing loading states
- **Skeleton Verification**: Ensure skeleton components display correctly
- **Form Validation**: Test inline validation and API error handling
- **Security Testing**: Verify role-based access and authentication
- **Performance Testing**: Skeleton loading performance and user experience
