### **Platform Vision (From Recovered Specifications)**

#### **Core Principles**

- **Transparency by default** — Government should work in daylight
- **Trust through traceability** — Every record, every change, every action is
  inspectable
- **Open-source and auditable** — No black boxes, no hidden logic
- **Equity and accessibility** — Built for everyone, not just the tech-savvy
- **Local-first resilience** — Works offline, in small towns, or at scale
- **Markdown as civic format** — Legible, versionable, future-proof civic
  records
