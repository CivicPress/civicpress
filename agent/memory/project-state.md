# üìä CivicPress Project State

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Specification Phase ‚Üí Implementation Phase  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## üéØ **Current Phase: Implementation**

CivicPress has completed a comprehensive specification phase and is now
transitioning to implementation. The project has a solid foundation of 50+
detailed specifications but minimal actual code implementation.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Foundation**

### Specification System

- **50+ Detailed Specs**: Complete design system covering all aspects
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-defined processes and guidelines
- **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security and testing specifications
- **Plugin Architecture**: Complete API design and development framework
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo setup with clear organization

### Design Decisions

- **Git-Native**: All civic records stored as Markdown in Git
- **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based system for extensibility
- **Security-First**: Sandboxed workflows and comprehensive audit trails
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance by default
- **Transparency**: All changes traceable and auditable

## ‚è≥ **Implementation Status**

### Core Platform (0% Complete)

- [ ] `civic-core.ts` - Main platform loader
- [ ] Hook system (`emitHook`) - Event system
- [ ] Workflow engine - Civic process automation
- [ ] Git integration - Role-aware commits
- [ ] CLI tools - Basic commands (`civic init`, `civic lint`)

### Civic Modules (5% Complete)

- [ ] Legal-register module - Basic structure exists
- [ ] Record validation - Specified but not implemented
- [ ] Lifecycle management - Specified but not implemented
- [ ] Approval workflows - Specified but not implemented

### Development Tools (10% Complete)

- [ ] Specification validation tools - Partially implemented
- [ ] Testing framework - Specified but not implemented
- [ ] Development documentation - Needs expansion
- [ ] Example implementations - Not started

### User Interface (0% Complete)

- [ ] Basic civic dashboard - Not started
- [ ] Record viewing and navigation - Not started
- [ ] Feedback submission interface - Not started
- [ ] Role-based editing tools - Not started

## üöß **Active Work Areas**

### Priority 1: Core Implementation

- **Focus**: Building the foundational civic-core.ts loader
- **Goal**: Get basic platform running with hook system
- **Timeline**: Next 2-4 weeks

### Priority 2: Development Experience

- **Focus**: Implementing specification validation tools
- **Goal**: Enable developers to work with the spec system
- **Timeline**: Parallel with core implementation

### Priority 3: Legal Register Module

- **Focus**: Complete the first civic module
- **Goal**: Demonstrate the platform with real functionality
- **Timeline**: After core implementation

## üîÑ **Next Milestones**

### Week 1-2: Core Foundation

- [ ] Implement civic-core.ts loader
- [ ] Build basic hook system
- [ ] Create simple workflow engine
- [ ] Add Git integration basics

### Week 3-4: Development Tools

- [ ] Implement specification validation
- [ ] Build testing framework
- [ ] Create development documentation
- [ ] Add example implementations

### Week 5-6: First Module

- [ ] Complete legal-register module
- [ ] Add record validation
- [ ] Implement basic workflows
- [ ] Create approval processes

## üö® **Current Blockers**

1. **No Core Implementation**: Need to start building the actual platform
2. **Limited Examples**: Need working examples to demonstrate concepts
3. **Testing Gap**: No testing framework to validate implementations
4. **Documentation Gap**: Need more implementation-focused docs

## üìã **Recent Decisions**

- **2025-01-27**: Decided to focus on core implementation before expanding
  modules
- **2025-01-27**: Prioritized specification validation tools for development
  experience
- **2025-01-27**: Chose to implement legal-register as the first civic module
- **2025-01-27**: Established APM-inspired memory system for AI agent continuity

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### Phase 1 Success (Core Implementation)

- [ ] CivicPress can load and run basic platform
- [ ] Hook system can emit and handle events
