# Lessons Learned

## Development Patterns

### UI/UX Best Practices

- **Consistent Page Structure**: Use `UDashboardPanel` and `UDashboardNavbar`
  template slots for all pages
- **Skeleton Loading**: Implement skeleton components for better perceived
  performance
- **Inline Validation**: Form errors should be displayed inline, API errors as
  toasts
- **Hot Reload**: UI has hot reload, so never need to restart the UI server when
  making changes
- **Icon System**: Centralized icon registry prevents infinite loops and ensures
  consistency

### Loading System Architecture

- **Skeleton Components**: `UserCardSkeleton`, `RecordCardSkeleton`,
  `FormSkeleton`, `AvatarSkeleton`, `DashboardCardSkeleton`
- **Loading Composable**: `useLoading.ts` provides centralized loading state
  management
- **Delay Middleware**: Configurable API delays for testing loading states in
  development
- **Consistent UX**: All pages follow standardized loading patterns with
  skeleton screens

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Role-Based Access**: Dynamic role system with granular permissions
- **Admin User Management**: Complete CRUD operations for user management
- **Security**: Password fields cleared after submission, proper session
  management
- **Public vs Protected**: Clear distinction between public and authenticated
  endpoints

### API Design

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Consistent API patterns across all modules
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Middleware**: Auth middleware applied selectively to protected routes
- **Configuration**: Public endpoints for UI configuration (roles, record types,
  statuses)

### Testing & Development

- **API Delay Testing**: Use `API_DELAY=true` and `API_DELAY_MS=3000` for
  testing loading states
- **Skeleton Testing**: Visit pages during API delays to verify skeleton
  components
- **Hot Reload**: UI changes apply immediately without server restart
- **Development Mode**: Enhanced logging and debugging features

## Technical Decisions

### Loading System Implementation

- **Skeleton Components**: Re-enabled all skeleton components for comprehensive
  loading states
- **Delay Middleware**: Created configurable API delay middleware for
  development testing
- **Loading States**: Implemented skeleton loading for users, records, forms,
  and dashboard
- **Performance**: Skeleton components provide better perceived performance than
  spinners

### User Management System

- **Complete CRUD**: Full user management with create, edit, delete operations
- **Role Management**: Dynamic role selection from system configuration
- **Password Features**: Generate strong passwords, show/hide visibility,
  strength indicators
- **Form Validation**: Inline validation with API error handling via toasts

### Authentication Architecture

- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with proper token management
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions system with role definitions
- **Session Management**: Automatic token validation and session persistence
- **Security**: Password security, input validation, and proper error handling

### API Structure

- **Public Endpoints**: Configuration endpoints accessible without
  authentication
- **Protected Endpoints**: User management and record operations require
  authentication
- **Middleware**: Selective application of auth middleware to specific routes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Infinite Loop Prevention

- **Icon System**: Non-reactive icon resolution prevents infinite loops
- **Computed Properties**: Careful use of computed properties to avoid reactive
  loops
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types prevent runtime errors
- **Debugging**: Use browser console and API logs to identify loop sources

### Loading State Management

- **Skeleton Components**: Provide better UX than spinners during API delays
- **Loading States**: Implement loading states for all async operations
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states with retry functionality
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized loading patterns across all pages

### Form Validation

- **Inline Errors**: Form validation errors displayed with fields
- **API Toasts**: Success/error messages for API interactions
- **Security**: Password fields cleared after submission
- **User Feedback**: Clear messaging for all user actions

### API Integration

- **Consistent Patterns**: Use `$civicApi` for all API calls
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper user feedback
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components during API calls
- **Hot Reload**: UI updates automatically without server restart

## Performance Considerations

### Loading Performance

- **Skeleton Components**: Better perceived performance than spinners
- **API Delays**: Configurable delays for testing loading states
- **Hot Reload**: Immediate UI updates without server restart
- **Consistent UX**: Standardized loading patterns across all pages

### Development Workflow

- **Hot Reload**: UI changes apply immediately without restart
- **API Testing**: Use delay middleware for testing loading states
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging and debugging in development mode
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized development patterns across modules

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication Security

- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and secure handling
- **Session Management**: Proper token validation and session persistence
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions with role definitions
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation

### API Security

- **Protected Endpoints**: Selective authentication middleware application
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **HTTPS**: Required for all authentication traffic in production

## Future Considerations

### Loading System Enhancements

- **Additional Skeletons**: More skeleton components for different content types
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
- **Performance**: Optimize skeleton rendering for large datasets
- **Accessibility**: Ensure skeleton components are accessible

### User Management Enhancements

- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export user data
- **Advanced Roles**: Hierarchical role system with inheritance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for user actions
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA support

### API Enhancements

- **GraphQL Support**: GraphQL API for complex queries
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time notifications for user events
- **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting with Redis
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for improved performance
