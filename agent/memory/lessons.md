# Agent Memory: Lessons Learned

## Test Infrastructure Lessons

### Test Setup Patterns

- **Centralized Fixtures:** Use shared test fixtures for consistent setup across
  all tests
- **Database Isolation:** Each test should use isolated database with unique
  temp directories
- **Git Repository Setup:** Initialize Git repos in test directories for history
  API tests
- **Role Configuration:** Create standardized role configs for all test
  scenarios
- **Authentication Bypass:** Use BYPASS_AUTH=true for test environments

### Test Execution Patterns

- **Parallel Execution:** Tests should run in parallel without interference
- **Proper Cleanup:** Always clean up test artifacts and temporary files
- **Isolation:** Each test should be completely independent
- **Mocking Strategy:** Use real implementations over mocks when possible

### API Testing Patterns

- **Response Structure:** All API responses should follow
  `{ success: true/false, data: ... }` format
- **Status Codes:** Use consistent HTTP status codes across all endpoints
- **Error Handling:** Include proper error messages and details
- **Authentication:** Test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios

### CLI Testing Patterns

- **JSON Output:** All CLI commands should support --json flag for
  machine-readable output
- **Silent Mode:** Implement --silent flag to suppress output
- **Exit Codes:** Use proper exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
- **Error Messages:** Provide clear, actionable error messages

### CLI Authentication Testing (Latest Lessons)

- **Mixed Output Handling:** CLI commands may output initialization messages
  before JSON
- **JSON Extraction:** Implement robust JSON extraction from mixed CLI output
- **Simulated Authentication:** Use simulated auth for testing instead of
  password auth
- **Brace Counting:** Use brace counting to find complete JSON objects in output
- **Error Recovery:** Handle JSON parsing failures gracefully with clear error
  messages

## Debugging Lessons

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Constraint Errors:** Ensure unique constraints are respected in
   test data
2. **Permission System:** Role configurations must match API permission strings
   exactly
3. **Git History:** Tests requiring Git history need proper repo initialization
4. **Response Structure:** API tests must expect correct response format
5. **Authentication:** Mock user setup must work with real permission system
6. **JSON Parsing:** CLI commands with mixed output require proper JSON
   extraction
7. **Test Authentication:** Use simulated auth for tests, password auth for real
   usage

### Test Environment Setup

- **NODE_ENV=test:** Essential for test-specific behavior
- **BYPASS_AUTH=true:** Required for authentication bypass in tests
- **Temporary Directories:** Use unique temp dirs for each test

  execution

### Build and Rebuild Process

- **Clean Rebuild:** Always clean and rebuild after major changes
- **Dependency Management:** Fix peer dependency issues before testing
- **Artifact Cleanup:** Remove temporary files and build artifacts
