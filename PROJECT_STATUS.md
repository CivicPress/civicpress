## Current Status: Planning Nuxt PWA Migration

### Recent Decisions (2024-12-19)

- **Migrate from Astro to Nuxt PWA** for unified Vue-based architecture
- **Single codebase** for both public browsing and admin functionality
- **PWA features** for better mobile experience and offline support
- **Static site generation** still possible with Nuxt

### What's Working Now

✅ **CLI** - Full functionality with authentication, record management  
✅ **API** - REST endpoints with authentication and public access  
✅ **Database** - SQLite with proper indexing and sync  
✅ **Git Integration** - Automatic commits and version control  
✅ **Authentication** - JWT-based with role management  
✅ **Astro Frontend** - Static site with record browsing (to be migrated)

### Migration Plan

🔄 **Phase 1:** Setup Nuxt PWA (1 hour)  
⏳ **Phase 2:** Migrate static pages (2 hours)  
⏳ **Phase 3:** Add admin interface (2 hours)  
⏳ **Phase 4:** API integration (1 hour)  
⏳ **Phase 5:** PWA features (30 min)  
⏳ **Phase 6:** Testing & deployment (30 min)

### Next Steps

1. **Start Nuxt PWA setup** in `modules/serve-nuxt/`
2. **Migrate homepage and record browsing**
3. **Add admin interface with CRUD operations**
4. **Deploy as PWA with offline support**

### Benefits After Migration

- **Unified Vue/Nuxt architecture**
- **PWA features** (offline, installable)
- **Better mobile experience**
- **Admin interface** for record management
- **Static generation** still possible
- **Single deployment target**
