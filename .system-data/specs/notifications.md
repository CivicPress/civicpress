## üìõ Name

Civic Notifications System

## üéØ Purpose

Enable CivicPress to notify relevant users or external systems when civic events
occur ‚Äî such as approvals, feedback received, or new proposals. This supports
transparency, accountability, and timely decision-making.

Notifications may be local (in-app), remote (webhook), or outbound (email/SMS).

## üß© Scope & Responsibilities

‚úÖ Responsibilities:

- Trigger notifications on system events (`hook:`-based)
- Support multiple channels (email, webhook, CLI, UI)
- Route messages based on user roles or subscriptions
- Log all notifications for auditing

‚ùå Out of Scope:

- Real-time presence or WebSocket chat
- Delivery retries or guaranteed delivery (handled by future queue system)

## üîê Security & Trust Considerations

### Notification Channel Security

- All webhook endpoints must be cryptographically signed with HMAC-SHA256
- Email addresses validated and verified before notification delivery
- Rate limiting per user and per notification type to prevent spam
- TLS encryption required for all outbound notification channels
- Webhook retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns

### Content Protection & Privacy

- Sensitive data automatically redacted from notification content
- Personal information (PII) filtered out of public notification logs
- Notification content encrypted in transit and at rest
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies for notification history
- User consent management for notification subscriptions

### Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-factor authentication required for notification system access
- Role-based access control for notification subscription management
- Audit trail of all notification system access and configuration changes
- Session management with automatic timeout for notification admin interfaces

### Delivery Verification & Compliance

- Delivery receipts and read confirmations for critical notifications
- Non-repudiation through cryptographic signatures on notification payloads
- Compliance logging for legal and regulatory requirements
- Tamper-evident audit trails for all notification activities

### Abuse Prevention & Monitoring

- Machine learning detection of notification spam and abuse patterns
- Real-time monitoring of notification volume and delivery success rates
- Automated alerts for unusual notification patterns or failures
- Blacklist/whitelist management for notification recipients

### Data Sovereignty & Localization

- Notification data stored in compliance with local data protection laws
- Support for region-specific notification templates and requirements
- Localization of notification content and delivery preferences
- Cross-border data transfer compliance for international notifications

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- Trigger test events and confirm outbound logs
- Validate webhook delivery and fallback
- Ensure logs include timestamp, role, and event metadata
- Confirm CLI and API trigger hooks consistently

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Add queue system for retries and scheduling
- Support digest summary notifications (daily, weekly)
- Civic dashboard for notifications & history
- Citizen-facing subscription model (per record/tag)
